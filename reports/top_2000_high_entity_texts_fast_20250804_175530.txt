They are NOT Slippers, ... if you can just slip them on with the band in use, then the Back Band is useless.  Now most Sandals can be called Slippers due to they slip on BUT ALSO OFF.  Beach Slipper Sandals are only good to wear for the Shower area (Beach, Swimming Pools and other Public areas with washing self Areas).  Also if you are going to wear a Toga or some other ancient costume.  The back band is actually a band that streches a little then snaps snug to back of ankle.

     Complete Text: The XXL I ordered is an 8-10 at best. I am not overweight and usually wear a 10-12 in shirts, but I ordered the XXL (14) because I have a larger bust, live in a hot climate and wanted the shirt to fit loosely. This shirt didn't fit anywhere. The arms were too tight, the sleeves were too short and it was very fitted, not loose at all. The measurements given must be for the actual inches from seam to seam, not the &#34;sized to fit X inches&#34; we're used to on US/European size charts. US/European sizes incorporate wearing ease, which is actual inches plus enough extra length or width to allow you to move, bend, sit, etc, comfortably. To make this even a fitted shirt, you'd probably have to add at least 2&#34; to the stated measurements on the chart. For a loose fit, add at least 4&#34;. Additionally, the fabric is so see through that if you perspire or get caught in the rain, this shirt will become transparent.<br /><br />I wish that Amazon would require that the sellers of Asian produced clothing either, A) produce clothing to US/European size standards or B) be required to post that the clothing is sized for the Asian market and the stated sizes will be much smaller than expected.  I would wish for option &#34;A&#34; because there are probably good vendors out there that are selling clothing on Amazon that are sized as expected for this market, but as the saying goes, &#34;once bit, twice shy&#34;. Until something changes, either shop for clothing elsewhere or anticipate that your chances of receiving a garment that fits as you expect is a crap shoot at best.

The Charge 2 is a lot lighter than the Charge HR that it is replacing, to add that much weight makes no sense.  I wanted to dress up the band, not add wrist weights to work out during the day.  As a comparison, the band alone (no Charge attached) is heavier than my entire Rolex GMT Master and band, and I consider the Rolex a heavy watch.

The wrist and waist bands stay snug. It did shrink a little but not to much. I think everyone expects a hoodie to shrink a little. The best part is it shrank proportionally. If you're like me you want a hoodie you can just throw in the washer and dryer without having to worry about it coming out fitting differently. I'm 6'1" 190 lbs with an athletic build and the XL is a perfect fit after a wash and dry. If you like a looser fit like an XL Carhartt, I would go with a XXL Russell. I have both and I like how the XL Russell fits perfect. My XL Carhartt fits a little baggy.

What a nice watch! It keeps very accurate time ...within 3 or 4 seconds a day. I recently learned that Seiko owns a controlling interest in Orient, a brand I was not familiar with, a few months back. Their watches seem to be more accurate than similarly-priced Seiko automatic watches. I've bought 4 different Orient watches in the past few months and have been very impressed with both their construction and accuracy. They deserve to be better known! There are relatively few retail outlets to purchase them, so buying them on Amazon at a low price is a no-brainer. This watch is about the same size as a plethora of the Seiko 5 series, so if you're shopping for one of them, you might want to cross-shop similar Orient models. This watch can be used for casual or dress wear. The leather band is very well made and not one of those cheapie ones that comes on a $30 watch. The black face with contrasting large numbers at the 12,6 and 9 positions make it easy to read for those of us with aging eyes! All-in-all, I got a very nice watch for not much money! I wonder if someone slipped up on the price!!!

     Complete Text: It's a bit boxey, but it has very nice stretchy, yet structured fabric, nice seams and finishes. The color is true to the picture, the cut is flattering, although, it runs a bit large, I bought the XL. I usually buy EU 44/ US12, but I'm a 32E, so normally a large is too tight on top. I would describe the fit as (EU 46/ US 14-16). If you are busty, this adds to the boxiness with the broad-shoulder cut of the design. The length was perfect for me (5'6/170cm). Nb! Be careful when you iron it, use the lowest possible setting, there are no labels explaining the textile makeup.

Went ahead and ordered it anyway hoping the one I received was flawless. And it is flawless, despite having the same buckle markings so many have commented about.  Upon closer inspection I noticed the left hand "V" portion of the Wornikoff "W" is supposed to depict a set of watch hands (at 11:05, see pic).  It can be easy to mistake this as an engraving error.<br /><br />That being said... I purchased the Sapphire Blue strap which matches my blue Casio Duro perfectly.  Its luster or sheen catches the light just like a sunburst watch dial does, its as if the strap was made for this watch.  Not to mention that the material is soft, flexible, and very comfortable.  Easily the best quality NATO strap I've bought on Amazon (and I've bought a few).

     Complete Text: Growing up a big Red Sox fan, I was excited to add this hat to my golf collection.  I love the look and feel of it, how you get your typical golf hat with Titleist on the front but it still throws in the Red Sox logo on the side.  It's not too overwhelming with the team pride, but just enough to show you're a fan.  Unfortunately the hat never seemed to fit right.  As much as I wanted to love this hat, I just could never feel comfortable wearing it for an extended stretch.<br /><br />I grew up wearing a hat every day until my mid-to-late 20s, and while I don't wear them often anymore, I do on the golf course, and comfort is #1 priority for me.  Unfortunately this one did not make the cut and has just become clutter over the years.  My Nike FlexFit is much more comfortable and always wins out.

     Complete Text: This is a great hat and worth the money. Resistol has a great reputation for hat making and didn't let me down with this hat. The hat was made in Mexico with genuine Mexican palm straw. I purchased it to wear while doing yard work but I'm having second thoughts about using it for that purpose because the hat is so nice and of such good quality. The hat could be used for summer dress or casual wear and even during gardening if that is what you choose. The style is also very nice and just what I wanted. I would certainly buy another one of these hats and recommend it to others. Its name, Brush Hog Mexican Palm Straw Hat, doesn't give it much credit and makes it sound like a roughly made hat which it isn't. I wear between a 6 7/8 and 7 so I got the size 7 and it fits fine. The hat appears to be true to size.

     Complete Text: After the frame of my old and trusty MTB sunglasses snapped in half, I bought these HiHiLLs, together with the [[ASIN:B06XPB8ZDM Torege Polarized Sports Sunglasses With 4 Interchangeable Lenses for Men Women Cycling Running Driving Fishing Golf Baseball Glasses EMS-TR90 Frame TR033]]. This way I could directly compare the fit, looks and quality of both.<br /><br />It’s a clear case of “you get what you pay for”, as the Toreges, although slightly higher priced, are the better glasses. The sizing and fit of these HiHiLLs is horrible: the frame is way too wide, and the glasses sit too high and too much forward on my nose (probably to make room for the myopia lens insert). The photos show how the Torege frame will give a much tighter and smoother fit and therefore a better look. I also prefer the more glossy finish of the Toreges, as compared to the cheap plastic matte look of these HiHiLLs. The comfort of the nose bridge is similar: unfortunately not great, but hopefully satisfactory for a 1-2 hour bike ride.<br /><br />Considering the number of accessories and value for money, these glasses could deserve 3 stars, were it not for the poor, unacceptable coating on the multicolored (rainbow) lens: one corner was missed completely, resulting in an asymmetrical finish, rendering the lens useless for me. This is the reason I remove another star and I’m sending these back to get myself another pair of the Torege sunglasses to be used for driving.

When I measured next to three other size 10.5 shoes; it becomes obvious that the shoe is approximately one inch longer.  It seems to fit until the foe sheepskin compacts down.  Net net...  This is a minimum of half, or more likely, a full size  larger than it is labeled.  So, instead of 10.5; I found the size to be 11.5.<br />Read the companies Rules For A Return...  I returned item and expected the return to be recognized or listed as "in progress".  It has been four days and my Amazon account only shows the return has been authorized.  There is no recognition that it was dropped off at UPS.  Four or five years ago, that would have been almost expected.

The material is quality and the dress held it's shape when I put it through a heavy night of dancing to Buddy Holly music in Clear Lake, IA!  I've rinsed the dress out once and ironed it.  Colors are still bright and dress still fits great.  The material has a bit of stretch so if I gain or loose a little weight, the dress should still fit.  If I were to change anything about the dress, I would give it a little more flare. I like my dresses to go straight out when I twirl.  This doesn't but I'd still buy it again.

Well, I found something I love for a GREAT price. I got these in the red and have worn them many, many times.  They pop an all black outfit, or all white (I live in South FL).  The tassel isn't too much or too long and has stayed nice for 8 months.  The the sun flower design above the tassel is very pretty, making this more than just a long drop, tassel earring. Well worth what I paid for them 8 months ago ($8.99) and now I found a set of 9 for $12.99 in all different colors and styles of tassel right here on Amazon.  What a great way to follow a trend without spending a lot of money.

     Complete Text: I purchased these Yoga socks at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.  First I must tell you that the socks are cute, and they fit me well.  I really like the non-skid bottom which didn't entail a bunch of bumpy dots on the bottom.  These were actually comfortable to walk in, and were comfortable overall.  The toes fit nicely which was nice, since I have tried other brands where the toes were too short.  The only downfall, and unfortunately the most important thing for a pair of Yoga socks, is the fact that they won't stay on your feet during Yoga practice.  This actually created unsafe situation in most of the Yoga moves.  So, if you want a pair of socks, that are comfortable, that you can maybe wear around the house, these might be nice.  I would not recommend them for Yoga practice though.

What's most interesting is that the bridesmaid/bride sunglasses set was a full $2 cheaper than this package for groomsmen, but was a least three times better quality.<br /><br />This groomsmen set is basically what you expect: cheap, one-time-use-only flexible sunglasses with cheap, easy-to-rub-off paint on the sides. However, the other company's sunglasses had sturdy, durable plastic frames and engraved "Bride" and "Bridesmaid" lettering. A world of difference. If you are okay with these sunglasses being used for one day only, and you don't mind if the wording rubs off too easily, then this might be a worthy purchase. For 4-5 hours for our wedding, it did the job. However, if we'd had more time, we would have preferred to go through a higher-quality store, perhaps on Etsy. Good luck!

It fits a little loose which is what I wanted but not in the arms, those fit perfectly.

Being cheap and something my daughter could afford I sent her the link.  When I received it I found it is not a Swiss Army watch.  The box does not include instructions.  The timer bezal is glued in place and does not turn at all so it and the compass bezal are strictly ornamental.  I went to the web site on the box and found that it is not water resistant so the depth meter is just there for show.  This is a good watch for a child that tells time only and has a cool military look.  If you want the actual functions like the bezal and depth meter you will need to spend more money to get them.  I guess you really get what you pay for.

My only complaint is that it's not completely accurate to King's uniform in the show. The buttons on the back should have x's like on the front and there are solid black lines that should be fold-like patterns as shown in the show. Also, it's just a little too baggy for my taste but it doesn't ruin the overall product. Those are just personal nitpicks but other than that I highly recommend if you're a fan of the Seven Deadly Sins.

     Complete Text: I had purchased a pair of Hunters before I read the tons of online reviews about their now being made in China and the unending issues with the quality and lack of long-term durability. Upon opening the box, I was met with the noxious smell of rubber. I had heard this was an issue for many as well. I am particularly sensitive so I knew they would have to go back for this reason alone. It turns out they had sent me the incorrect size anyways so they definitely had to go back anyways.<br /><br />After reading the Hunter reviews, I noticed that people kept mentioning Aigles which are made in France. Amazon was selling them for much less than their retail website and with super fast shipping so I went ahead and ordered the Equibelle b/c I really liked the look of this particular boot. The box it came in was completely crushed and crumpled like it had been through much wear and tear but the boots inside were fine. I like that the calf width is more narrow than most rubber boots and doesn't have an adjustment strap. I usually wear a US size 8 boot so I had ordered the UK size 39. It is roomy enough that I can wear a bulky pair of wool socks w/o them feeling tight. There seems to be a bit of extra room at the top of the foot area where the ankle and the foot meet. This makes the boot look a little sloppy when walking. I love the blue color strip at the top. It appears to be made of actual strip of blue rubber vs. black rubber that has just been painted blue so I'm hoping it will not wear or chip off. The blackness of the boot when compared to a true black like a pair of leggings is more of a dark gray and is not as polished as it appears in the picture. I had hoped to be able to wear these with a nicer outfit to work but they don't look quite dressy enough for that. They are super comfy for walking about on pavement though my feet do sweat a bit in them so I would never wear them w/o absorbent socks.<br /><br />So glad I found these! Thinking that they will last me a very long time.

I also thought the material would be a little heavier.<br />I contacted the seller asking if there was a larger size and unfortunately there are none.  The seller responded quickly and was quite helpful.  They have issued a refund and told me I could keep the top.  Even though I am not a seamstress,  I will try to make this top work.<br /><br />I do like the style of clothes from Mordenmiss and I will purchase more in the future.

I have to say that I happen to have a very large chest area. However, all other things that I purchase that is XL works just fine. If not for that, I would not have mentioned it. Perhaps mine was mismarked, I do not know. All I know for certain is that it does not work well over my ample chest. It is a decent enough length, but it doesn't close over my chest. I live in Florida, so I was thrilled to have this beautiful, lightweight option. Perhaps as I keep getting smaller--but still, my chest doesn't really ever go away. My advice for anyone who wants a lovely, lightweight robe is to Size up--if you happen to be a woman that is more well endowed up top. As for the length, if you are above average height, it will not be as long as you think either. Overall, I still think it is gorgeous, I just may give it to my (not so well-endowed) daughter. Maybe. Otherwise, I will just keep it to wear because it is so silky.<br /><br />Excellent seller! Super fast shipping! I got mine with TWO DAYS with Prime!!

It has a strap for when it's closed too, so it doesn't get caught up in the wind. Cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I looked (including Target patio sale).

I ordered XXL but returned it ( too large) then ordered XL which is what I normally order in shirts and it fits true to size with just enough extra flounce in the skirt on top. I'm 5'6&#34; and the top falls just beneath the bottom of the panty in front. The bottoms are a little loose on me but that's only because I normally wear a size 8 on the bottom. It dries quickly which is uncommon for most suits in this style that I have worn. The bra top offers plenty of coverage and support but, again, doesn't look at all matronly or old-fashioned. I have already gotten plenty of use and compliments from this suit!

I went a half size up from my shoe size; 8.5 to 9, because I read sandals should be a size larger than your shoe.  They fit perfectly to say the least.  Then I had my brother order these for me, and I just received them yesterday.  I got the white and brown because they are just stylin'; what can I say?  What I did not expect is the leather is pure rawhide leather!  Awesome flip-flops, but rough leather on the top of my feet with no socks is pretty uncomfortable.  I think once these are broken in they will end up being my favorite sandals ever.  The leather actually grips my toes and feet a little better than the synthetic material on the Phantoms, so mainly its a matter of getting used to the chafing on the top of my feet (the only reason I gave these four stars instead of five,) and wearing the leather down to a softer texture for more walking comfort.  On top of that, judging by the durability of these (finer stitching, better molding, etc.,) these will probably last 5+ years where I think I'll be lucky to get 3 years out of the Phantoms.  All in all, I love Reef sandals, and as soon as I get used to these, they will be five stars to me.

It's extrememly difficult to put it over my wrist w/o the help of another person, which is obviously the biggest drawback. The rubber envelopes the Fit2 where you can't charge it w/o taking it off, and for me the Fit2 didn't read my heartbeat unless the band was tighter than I'd like.

There is another brand that looks very similar to these and the seal lasts longer and the goggles them selves are a little softer. The frame of this one is stiff.

So this one looks, feels great as all other Casio watches and I paid under $10 all included. If you are an amateur or serious watch lover/collector you Must have this one and a few more Casio watches in your collection. I like the seller and the great price value they offer.<br />Thank you and I will buy a few more from them.

     Complete Text: I was impressed with the WiliW Women's Control Top Pantyhose because they are sheer and feel very silky, I'm way past due on a mani-pedi and thought I would surely snag them as I hurriedly tried them on. It's been a long time since I tried on pantyhose, and they survived with minimal damage and no runs. I am 5'3", 119 lbs, and typically wear a size small in bottoms. The size medium was a perfect fit, so they do run small. You'll want to size up if you are average height or carry a bit more weight. The control top was okay, but will not perform the miracles of good shapewear. I am not aware of any pantyhose that can. I consider this three-pack to be an excellent value, especially for this quality. I highly recommend these!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **

It doesn't show on the picture but was a real shock when received!  Since caftans are often purchased by women trying to hide flaws, this is a major &#34;design flaw&#34;......it adds a LOT of weight to the hip and thigh section.

No tracking info was available and every time I messaged the sellers they sent me tracking info that appeared made up as the previous dates and stops changed each time. Second, when it finally did arrive today it is such poor quality. The color is completely different than what is pictured. The picture online looks kind of like a dusty rose pink. What I received it “It’s A Girl!” pink. The fabric is so cheap it makes a noise when it moves. That coupled with the horrible color makes it look like a toddler’s pageant dress. One side of the neckline is higher than the other as you can see in the picture and there are little strings sticking out everywhere!! The whole thing is awful.

     Complete Text: I go through umbrellas very fast. Mostly because I put them in sleeves in a salt water pool. I've gone through a variety, and I now have three Tempera umbrellas. My oldest one has held up incredibly well. The fabric doesn't fade like less expensive umbrellas and most importantly, the bodies are aluminum and not iron. This makes them both lighter weight, but also much better in handling wet environments. The iron umbrellas always end up rusting out, even with the powder coating.<br /><br />This Tempera umbrella was super easy to assemble, it literally took 30 seconds. The tilt mechanism is a an auto-crank which I far prefer to manual tilt mechanisms. You just simply keep cranking and it automatically tilts!<br /><br />I really like the chili red color, it's not super bright and has a bit of a texture to it. The fabric feels thicker and more durable than other umbrellas, and like I said, my older Tempera hasn't faded at all so I have high expectations for this one. I really highly recommend Tempera umbrellas!

     Complete Text: **UPDATE**<br />My mother in law has had this since Christmas 2018, and in that time she's let my SUPER destructive 2-year-old play with the bracelet it is on at LEAST 10 times, and it has held up absolutely great!  I'm honestly VERY impressed with the quality of this charm.  I was certain it would be the first to break on her Pandora bracelet, and it has yet to (and I know he has tried to break it.  He tries to break everything he touches.)<br /><br />I bought this for my mother in law for Christmas because I knew she was doing something extravagant for me, but I just didn't have the funds to get her a legitimate charm from Pandora.<br />I made up for the lack of funding by making her a heart-shaped box by hand that was lined with Red Panne (A sort of stretchy velour similar in look to velvet - Think Christmas Tree Skirts) so she appreciated that at least.<br /><br />The charm itself looks amazing given how tiny these things are.  The wording was VERY easily legible unlike many of these cheaper charms on Amazon.  The plating appeared to be done very well, and I KNOW plating, given that my family owns one of the last Hard-Plating shops in America!  Getting an accurate plating on something that's this small, and has as many tiny corners as it does is nearly impossible, so there WILL be tiny flaws that are barely noticeable to the naked eye (and probably won't be visible to someone that isn't trained to see them the way I am.)<br />It doesn't appear to be a hard-plate, so it won't last a lifetime, but I've no doubts that it'll at least last a good few years if not longer.  They say it's sterling silver, but I'm not too sure about that claim.  I'm pretty certain it's a plating just because of the inconsistencies in the corners.  (Again, one of those things you only notice when you're trained to.)<br /><br />I tried to crush it with my fingers to see if it was plated pewter or anything of the sort, and it held steadfastly, so it's at LEAST a decent grade stainless steel under the plating which is good since you don't have to worry about it bending, or warping.<br /><br />Overall, I'd DEFINITELY recommend buying this.  While the cost might not be "premium" the quality of the item definitely is.  People always feel inadequate because they didn't spend an exorbitant amount of money on a gift, and that's just not how it should be.  Make something that shows someone you care, don't buy it (Hence the box).

In case you don’t know what a ouroboros is it is an ancient Greek symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. The ouroboros eats its own tail to sustain its life, in an eternal cycle of renewal.<br /><br />This ring says it’s for a man but I found it to be unisex and I’m not a guy so there ya go.  It’s not a shiny ring but made of pewter and its lead free.  Great detail work using black to accentuate the snake’s scales and make the ring look old.  The Swarovski crystal green eyes were the finishing touch.  Maybe used because green is the color of new growth in nature?  I liked it because it’s seems like a Slytherin kind of ring and I sorted into that house on Pottermore.<br /><br />I love how it looks on my pointer finger.  It’s definitely an attention grabber.

The leather sides block out ambient light that reflects back into your eyes with normal sunglasses.  Some think the design is a bit dated, but I like the large round lenses.  Very easy to see out of.  These are great for all types of activities except for driving.  You must really turn your head all the way around to get a good view of what's beside you before changing lanes.  They hold up really well.  I was very tough on the first pair.  The 2nd pair I took much better care of and gave them to my son.  I lost the next pair and bought a couple more recently to replace them.  They are VERY hard to find because they have been discontinued, at least in the U.S. as far as I can tell.  The nose piece has to be worked on a little for comfort.  Also, on the last pair, I had to adjust the side rails.  But compared to other glasses... never mind, there is no comparison.  These are awesome!!!

I wouldn't have minded, but because it was loose and the bra padding wasn't tight either, it just felt too uncomfortable.  Maybe if I was a bigger cup it would been a better fit, but being a B, I knew that being in the water it the pads would just be floating around.  You can take the pads off, but I didn't want to wear another suit underneath.<br /><br />The zipper was annoying as well.  It bent backwards especially the top part, and it kept digging into my throat.  I had a red spot within a couple of minutes of wearing.<br /><br />At the end, I decided to buy another rash guard that was a better fit.

Because they were super light they felt comfortable resting on my nose. I've worn glasses/sunglasses most of my life and comfortable fitting glasses can make or break your day. I could totally wear these all day long. I'm glad I was given the chance to buy these at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I love Polarized lenses. It really cuts the glare/reflection.

My wife say that the ride is so much more comfortable because she can sit upright and still have somthing secure to hold onto. It also takes all of the weight off of my wrists and I don't even notice that she is there!  The handles are very well made and it was no problem for me to wear at all!  How is this product not more recognized than it is??? Either way we will never ride without it again!

     Complete Text: When I ordered this, I ordered a womens slipper. At the time of ordering it, that was what the product said and in my order history, it says WOMENS slipper. I clicked the link to show my dad what I had ordered my mom for christmas and saw the headline said mens. Confused, I double checked my order and the order said womens. I contacted support and Amazon told me that sometimes when a product goes out of stock, sellers will shift products.<br /><br />So men, first, be warned that some of the reviews might be for a WOMENS slipper and women, be warned that some might be for a mens. This is just confusing and should not be a thing.<br /><br />That being said, the amazon seller assured me that the product I was delivered would be a womans slipper and so I tried to relax, as the slippers in question were already wrapped and under the tree.<br /><br />Come christmas day, my mother opens the box and sure enough, they are mens slippers. Luckily, they fit, but they rub at the side of her toe and caused quite a blister. She doesn't want to send them back, but I wanted to leave this review, as I'm very unhappy with this whole ordeal.

She's about 4'10&#34;, 115 lbs and very small chested.  I got the size 2-4 and it fit perfectly everywhere, not too big or small in any area.<br /><br />It arrived the night before 'picture day' so she was thrilled to wear it to school the next day.  Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, teachers, coaches, principal, boyfriend and friends alike absolutely RAVED over the dress!!!  Her Spanish teacher called me a couple days later to discuss an assignment but the first thing out of her mouth was &#34;that's an amazing dress, where did you get it?&#34;  And she was shocked at how little it cost.<br /><br />The material of the dress was way beyond expectation for the price.  It's a sturdy, non-see-though yet super silky to the touch, though I'd say it's more of a satin material.  Trust me, despite whatever low reviews you see, this is a quality dress.  If your big chested you may have a problem with it, but I'd say order slightly bigger than what you may think if that's the case, OR, if you're curvy.  I'll definitely be buying from this company again!

     Complete Text: Absolutely love these sunglasses. I don't buy $$$ sunglasses because I tend to lose or break mine. And let's be honest, trends change so much, why spend big bucks for sunglasses you won't be wearing in a year or two. The packaging out of the box told me these were going to be quality sunglasses. I especially like the case and lens wipe that came with because I never use anything but to clean my glasses and sunglasses. The design is on par with Dolce & Gabanna or Ray Ban aviators. A sleek classic look that will never go out of style. They're also a nice weight so I know they won't fall apart on me and won't break if I accidentally drop them. They're also very well constructed which totally shocked me at this price point. Sometimes you try on sunglasses and they sit crooked on your face, and the more you adjust the worse they get...not the case with these. The nose piece seems easily adjustable (none needed for me), and the hinges for the earpieces are nice and tight. The tint of the lenses is also spot on. I live in Texas...the flat state...and drive due west every day after work into the blinding sun. Since using these sunglasses I notice I don't wince as much on the drive. I also like that they're dark enough that people can't see my eyes when I'm wearing them. I normally hate shopping for clothing or accessories online because you never know what the quality will be like, now how they're going to fit and I hate dealing with returns if they don't. I don't have anything to worry about with these.<br />P.S.- I'm one of those people who only read the negative reviews of products when shopping online. It's so nice to know that I can count on HDCRAFTER products to be first rate with future purchases...and there will be lots.

The high waist is double layered to give you a clean waistline, but is not too night or restricting, and doesnt roll. For those like me who have a little "junk in the trunk" - you will live these because they dont have that horrible dip in the back that some leggings have. Gaiam is my favorite leggings brand for that reason, but these are hands down the cutest. I quit wearing them to work out in because I rather wear them for casual outings. They are awesome.

     Complete Text: So, one thing to note is that I think these gloves run a little big. I ordered medium because I normally wear a medium glove and they were just way too big for my hand. Kudos to the seller though, responded immediately and sent me a replacement in small.<br /><br />Glove Look and Feel - these gloves look great, very thin (which is what I wanted) and flexible. The inside is lined with a soft fabric that adds to the warmth.<br /><br />Glove and Phone - So, these aren't replacements for fingers. If you're going to use a game that requires high accuracy then I suggest just using your fingers. If you want to answer a call or knock out a text these gloves are FANTASTIC. Easily twice as good as my last pair of phone friendly gloves which I must add cost me three times as much.<br /><br />The Motorcycle Test - I feel I have to share this. I live in Seattle and it's pretty friggin cold up here. I decided to wear these gloves on a bike ride because I couldn't find the other ones. It is amazing how warm they kept me. The air doesn't leak through the seams like in my other gloves, so the warmth kept really well.<br /><br />Overall, overjoyed with these gloves. would buy again.

The fabric is stretch but not overly so and heavy enough that I'm not afraid my keys are going to rip a hole through the fabric.  These would make pretty decent mountain biking shorts if you got them in the right size.  I will try them out with a belt and see if I can turn them into a pair of riding shorts.

However, every time I tried to wear this, the cheap metal of the clasp would break the underside of my wrist out in a TERRIBLE rash that would get itchy and scabby and last for days after wearing it just once. I tried to coat the clasp in clear nail polish so it wasn’t directly touching my skin - no luck, it still irritated the skin. If you’re not sensitive to cheap metals, this would be a good buy, but if you are, definitely steer clear.

The compression band is not as wide as other leggings I have found and they fit weird...like the compression band gives you the opposite of a muffin top...in order to get the crotch part pulled up enough the compression part is actually over the part of my belly that I need it to help suck in.

However, when I wore these socks, I couldn’t feel the cold air! They kept me warm and toasty without causing my feet to get too warm with activity. They also have a nice amount of cushion to support my feet. These are tall socks and came just below my knee joint, so they’ll keep the whole bottom half of your legs warm!

I like the green dress a lot and returned it (for free) and ordered a Large. Now it fits the way it's suppose to, like a glove!<br />It deserves 3 ⭐️ because of the wacked out sizing. But the FREE RETURNS (easy and convenient) earn it a ⭐️<br />I will say, in conclusion, though the returning was easy, getting the right size the first is a game of slots.

It’s flowy, the material is soft and lightweight, so it’s absolutely perfect for wearing in the summer without feeling like you’re going to over heat. Her measurements are 46” bust (around the fullest part and under bust-line 36”) 36” waist and 41” hips. She weighs 165lbs currently and is 5’5” tall. The XL fits well and the drawstring makes the fit perfect. There’s a little extra room if she were to gain any weight and thanks to the drawstring if she continues to lose weight it will still fit.

     Complete Text: I ordered a couple of sets of these for various kids this Christmas, and the results were uniformly good.  The build quality is solid, apparently either stainless steel or chrome plated something-something, and of course the loupes close, so they protect themselves reasonably well from e.g. impact and dirt; they're not as tiny as some higher-end instruments (Belomo, Nikon) so they're a little easier for the tots to grok; the optical quality is plenty for garden-variety use (chromatically way better than some of my other cheapies); and at a couple bucks apiece, they're cheap enough that loss/casualty scenarios can be survived without financial anguish / wailing / gnashing of teeth.  30x seems a little generous to me for the magnification number, but my eyeball guess was that they magnify a single dimension around 5x-6x--that is, a 1mm thing will look like a 5-6mm thing--and if you square that, you're right in the neighborhood of 30x, so this claim may indeed be valid by some metrics and not by others.  The inside edges of the cover are just the tiniest bit sharpish, so I suppose a determined child could cut a finger, but this seems like a pretty minimal hazard for a kid who is old enough to grasp the concept of magnification.  They ship in pairs, with each one in a little plastic case exactly as pictured.  I think this is just swell and have a couple extra on hand to use as short-notice gifts to microscale humans at need.

     Complete Text: I like cotton shirts. I had thought this was a cotton shirt because the description says it's cotton. It's not. This is a 100% polyester shirt. It does not look like cotton nor does it feel like cotton. The tag on the shirt shows that it's not cotton.<br /><br />That aside, like other reviewers have said, this shirt sits somewhere between formal and casual. I think it's perfectly work appropriate if you're an office worker. It will look great with a pair of slacks.<br /><br />Even though the tag says machine wash gentle and no tumble dry, I dried it on low heat anyway, and it handled it just fine, except a SLIGHT  wrinkling of the collar seams (see photo). This is a big plus for me, it is also the main reason why I prefer cotton when I buy shirts - I can machine wash and tumble dry it. Line drying is a pain in the butt for me. So, even though this is not made of cotton, I am glad it dried well.<br /><br />It fits very loosely but I think it's super comfortable. I like the flow of the fabric. It doesn't cling to my body. When it came out of the dryer, there wasn't static. It's very nice.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice shirt. Not what I had expected when I ordered it, but I would recommend it. Just know that the style may be a little quirky... I call it a very Chinese FOB style. It's something I'd found very commonly seen in a Chinese speaking country.

     Complete Text: We recently moved to the coast of Oregon, lots of pine trees and rain. Love it here, learning about keeping the rain gutters debris free. Cleaned out the gutters during the first big rain of the season, my hands were aching from the cold. Ordered these gloves with the insulated liner, went out yesterday to install new drain guards and continue the debris removal. After two hours in the icy water my hands were dry and warm, these gloves are a game changer. Looking forward to today's outdoor project. Also, wore just the insulated liner to rearrange my freezer contents. Hands stayed warm and fingers limber. Can't sing the praises of these gloves enough, with arthritis cold can slow me down quickly, these gloves are allowing me to do all the winter outdoor work.

I did A LOT of shopping around for this item and did comparisons with about 8 - 10 stores, both on line and name brand. None of them came close to the XXL size and look. I bought the 20&#34; chain which is the perfect length even with the over-sized lettering. I have not gotten to wear my necklace yet - because it was kind of an early Christmas gift - but I can't wait. It is solid quality and comes with a REALLY NICE velvety bag to keep it in...was not expecting that. ALL of the great reviews this item received were not wrong. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this item!!!

The cut is not a junior cut which it is advertised as a Junior polo.  She doesn't like it because it's too baggy, loose in the middle and being a junior she wanted it &#34;fitted&#34; with the curves.<br /><br />I thought it'd be a great way to get what we needed quick instead of shopping the busy stores at Christmas time but I wasted $32 instead.  :(  Later I was in the mall and found exactly what she wanted at Aeropostle for $12 each.  Score.  :)  What do I do with these two shirts that she'll never wear?  I wore one for one day.  Not my kinda shirt either.  Duped.

Since I began using these socks I no longer have pain or discomfort in my legs, especially around my ankles.<br /><br />I bought 4 pairs this past summer in June. Recently one of those pairs began to have holes on both heels. It looks as though the tear began around the area where the seems meet.<br />I contacted HOFAM hoping they would replace them. I sent a emailed. They responded the same day. The customer service rep. apologized for my inconvenience and offered to send a replacement pair.  The replacement pair arrived 3 days later.  I've never bought from this company before. And now I'm glad I did. Amazing customer service.

     Complete Text: MITILLY Women's Boho Floral Print 3/4 Sleeve V-Neck Casual Flowy Long Maxi Dress with Pockets<br /><br />This dress isn't what I expected. I thought it would be a lightweight and "flowy" dress as described, but the material is that of a thick t-shirt and is quite heavy. Add in the long length and the 3/4 sleeves and it doesn't really work well for warm summer weather. The print doesn't look as nice in person, very pastel pink and baby blue making it look like something a little girl would wear. The buttons are just sewn on the front, they're not functioning buttons. This reminds me of a night gown that would be worn in the 1800's or something. Although the fit is comfortable I seriously doubt that I would ever wear this out in public. I will most likely be donating it.

     Complete Text: I like this shirt a lot! I'm happy about the adjustable shoulder straps- even though it's annoying to tie up at first, it will give a good fit once you get it right. I plan to sew it later to keep the straps at the same place to prevent any wardrobe malfunction! The fit is a bit boxy. I'm usually Med-Large. The large was like a tent on my, but the medium was perfect (36C, 32 waist). Ample room across the chest, long enough to hit just about the hips. The material was a stiffer kind of synthetic, so it feels cool and doesn't cling to any unfortunate bumps on the body. I got the one with the orange stripes (not actually yellow like in the picture, but still a nice light orange) and it seems elongating. Would buy another color soon.

     Complete Text: This item is pretty and comfy, but the material is described as cotton and it does not feel nor look like 100% cotton; I think it is more likely a cotton blend (there are no tags in the item.) I am 5'4.5&#34;, about 123 lbs and on me this cover up is pretty roomy. The hem stops a couple of inches above my knees, enough to cover the tops of my thighs (as pictured.) This item is described as fitting US sizes S-L, but I think if you wear a size large this cover up might be too tight on you, especially if you are looking for something that fits loosely. I bought this to wear as a cover up, but ended up wearing it as pajamas instead (with a matching bra and undies set underneath.) This item is really cute and comfortable.

     Complete Text: I purchased a pair of these to be a beater pair to wear in place of my rayban RB2140's I love so much.  I saw the picture of the item described and decided to take a chance.  The quality of the tortoise shell model is outstanding.  they have full metal supports down the legs like my Raybans do and the hinge seems to be of great quality.  The tortoise shell acetate is comparable to the rayban pair and the fit and function is top notch.<br /><br />They are accurate to the size quoted on the listing, slightly smaller than my 54mm bans. They also do not have the aggressive angle of the classic wayfarers, more like a mix between the new RB2130's and the RB2140's we all know and love. The polarization is even and professionally done, and the brown tint looks amazing.

Every time we head out one of us needs a glasses strap and we search through the ones we have and never can find one that works correctly..either too small or too large.  It’s been so frustrating sorting through the variety we have on hand and it takes a lot of time trying to fit them one at a time.  We have lost glasses while out in our kayaks because we have not had our straps. Now thanks to your innovative design we have solved our dilemma.  We have the perfect straps attached to all our sunglasses, and thanks for the fun variety of colors so we can change them when we want to.

However, I am excited to wear to this to work as I walk to the bus stop.  I commute via mass transit and waiting 5-10 minutes in 50-60 degree mornings you need something, but you don't necessarily want a coat.  Well this seems to be the ticket.

     Complete Text: Narrow, run small, fingers are far too long and there is minimal flexibility in these gloves. I’m a pretty big guy (6’1” 225 pound weightlifter) and I would need a XXXL for anywhere near a comfortable fit. I used the sizing chart and it’s a waste of time - my hands are 9.25 inches around according to the chart  the XL souls fit me - not even close. For $8 I’ll keep them but they are hard to get on my hands - better suited for women or guys with small hands. There’s a joke here but I’ll pass.<br /><br />Bottom line is that If you have small hands, order 1-2 sizes larger and if you have big hands, keep looking for a better sized pair of gloves. They do work on touch screen phones but they are so stiff it’s hard to have any dexterity when using a phone.

It is fairly stretchy, and has enough body that I sometimes use it as a cushion to sit on.<br /><br />If I wash the hat in a machine, it shrinks and becomes too tight and I have to buy a new one, but wool doesn't really need to be washed so I don't do that anymore. Sometimes I may soak it in water with a small amount of vinegar, and dry it on a towel.<br /><br />It is not the best wool hat that I've owned, but it is the best I can currently find on Amazon, and I have purchased a few of these. I think I have owned military hats with finer knitting. Sometimes there is a loop that sticks out a bit, but that is the most that I can complain about.

It is very simple and not many card slots though it has plenty of room for another card panel to have been inserted since the large zippered body allows for more volume but the space is not utilized well.😕 A newer non-plus sized phone with a phone case does not fit well in front pocket as I've had to force mine and work at stretching out closure flap in order for phone to fit. I'm sure that's what most people wish to do with the front pocket, is put their phones in it.. they should've made the pocket a quarter to half inch longer🙁 The width of the pocket it fine, it's the length that needs work. I was hoping to get this in black but so far, I've only seen the two oddly tinted colors offered. I chose the purple which is not an eggplant or plum that I hoped for according to pics and reviews, but is is rather a brownish with a wine/burgundy tone. So far, Stronghold RFID Wallets are the most protected according to tests and many reviews and the men that I know usually use Stronghold brand so I wanted something protective for me as well therefore I purchased one and chose this particular wallet for the pocket for my phone and the zippered enclosure as well as it being a wristlet. I will use and keep this for the time being but hopefully Stronghold will take these design issues into consideration when designing their next women's wristlet rfid wallet.<br />****update: This color has grown on me and I really do Like this color a lot now!!😁

I have a wide toe box, my foot measures a 6 1/2 but always up size to compensate, the size 7 US fit perfect, with no extra room. I would also size up if you plan to wear in wet conditions or wear thick socks, seems to me they might tighten up some.  I do not intend to wet these so no comments on that, the suede outer fabric calls to me to keep it dry.  The inside is soft and comfy on the soles of my feet, there is a slight hump for arch support, works for me.  All in all this boot seems well made, stylish, for the price.  Packaged in a box so the boots arrived in perfect condition.

I saw some reviews on YouTube before I bought this watch but it didn’t seem to be really small, turns out when I saw the watch that I bought it was so small like if it was made for women, the strap is very short and I don’t even have a big wrist but it was so difficult to but it on anyways. I like the look of the watch yes, and it’s a good watch specially because it’s a COSC trust me it’s worth it, if I would recommended? Yes! If you like small watches .

The hood and pocket zippers are not YKK which are less important zippers on the jacket. Reflective liner on the inside with a mesh protective covering helps to reflect the heat back to your body. The hood is detachable so if you really don't use hoods or want a lighter jacket the hood can be removed and stored. The chest is a little bit small compared to the waist of the jacket I guess they are expecting slightly rounder people than brawny.<br /><br />Stitching on the jacket is top notch with no loose threads and very straight seems, I like that the wrist bands are recessed slightly where they are covered by the outside of the jacket. In the snow or rain this helps to keep the wrist bands dry as they are not as exposed to the moisture or rain. It's very uncomfortable to me to have wet wrist bands when it's cold outside.<br /><br />There are front and back heating areas on the jacket with three temperature settings that are color-code to the level of power being used to heat the coils. I couldn't tell exactly how long the battery lasts on the high setting as the heating controls dropped from high to medium within 20 minutes of turning on the heat. The weather has been pretty mild this year, no cold cold days or nights to test how well this keeps you warm but I expect with the heater this jacket would be very comfortable in the mountains.<br /><br />No mention as to the type of material used for waterproofing the jacket so I assume it's not using DuPont Thinsulate or Gore-tex and at the price point of the jacket with the heater and battery I wouldn't expect a name brand waterproof breathable material. Overall I like this jacket and give it a thumbs up.

As you can tell from my pictures this dress is really stretchy. I usually wear a size 22 and got the XXL in this dress. It's pretty short not to wear with anything under, but not so short that I haven't work without something under. The sleeves of the dress are definitely loose like in the picture. Also, this will only look like the picture if you have NO chest. I have plenty of chest, so this is fitted more around the upper area and tummy. I do like that it's a light material because I get warm easy. I have noticed that after machine washing twice it's gotten really soft. Some of the seams look a little sketchy, but so far they've held up. I wouldn't buy this again, but I don't regret the purchase.

At 30 inches wide by 50 inches long, plus four inches of fringe at each long end, I have plenty of fabric to work with when deciding how to wear it.<br /><br />I ordered the teal, which my camera translated to a thoroughly gray color - admittedly it's got a bit more gray than my monitor color showed, but not much. It's really a lovely, soft, ocean-on-a-cloudy-day, blue.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it feels like a Pashmina, or cashmere, myself - the weave is too light. It does feel delicate and soft. Great to wear as a scarf and then pull over your head on those days when you suddenly need head/hair cover. It's not a thick fabric, so although there's enough for a sarong or skirt, I'm wearing a bathing suit underneath.  It makes a perfect shoulder wrap, though; it's a wonderful flight accessory, and it's a smashing scarf. And the price point is awesome. Very pleased with it.

The material is soft against the baby's skin. Frequently I find soft fuzzy outfits are soft on the outside for the people holding the baby to enjoy, but regular feeling or even scratchy against the baby. The colors are vibrant and the material did not get pills (a pet peeve of mine). There is a version of this with a zipper. I hunted for the snapping version of it because zippers buckle up on little babies and make them think they are about to be fed when it brushes against their mouth. Even though the weather is getting warmer, I wanted to have one warm fuzzy fleece outfit for my son in case I was going someplace with him when I knew it would be cold out, like my older son's evening baseball games.

These bifocals are clear on the upper portion, with no magnification (it’s just clear plastic, except for the amber sunglass shading), but at the bottom there’s magnification for clear up close vision (you choose what magnification strength you need when ordering. It’s best to know your prescription needs from an eye doctor, or at least try on different reading glasses strengths at a local store like Walmart). Anyway, these things are perfect for me. I hate wearing glasses in general, even sunglasses, but I can put these on and forget I’m wearing them. Very comfortable. The amber shading reduces the brightness of the sun without simply making everything dark like typical sunglasses. And they wraparound to block out most of the side light. This is my second pair—the first pair broke through no defect of their own, unfortunately they were smashed at work when I wasn’t even wearing them. I’ll buy a third pair when the time comes.

The necklace looked really neat in the picture, and I really liked the colors.<br /><br />I thought they were much less underwhelming when I received them, though.  There are two strands of &#34;potato&#34; shaped pearls. The way they lay on each strand of the necklace, though, is kind of &#34;kinky&#34;.  You'd definitely have to twist the necklace or intertwine the strands prior to wearing if you want it to look anything like the picture.<br /><br />I knew they wouldn't be round nor of flawless quality, but I didn't think they'd have noticeable rings (?  Seams? or whatever you'd call them) around the middle.  This characteristic is much more prominent on the beige colored pearls; actually, at first I thought it was thin plastic adhered to the pearls to keep them together. If they were cheaper I'd probably keep them, but I just feel like I can get more uniform and attractive jewelry elsewhere.  (And, interestingly enough, the &#34;Lightning Deal&#34; price is now the current Prime price..)

     Complete Text: [[VIDEOID:55ac7a52b61ffd7a659ad39fa5a60f13]] The RUISENT 1 Carat White Moissanite, platinum plated, 6-prong diamond engagement ring with adjustable band arrived as a size 5.5-6.0 US. It fit my size 5.5 finger perfectly until I showed it to my husband. He saw the adjustable band and had adjusted it significantly outward before I could stop him! Sadly, I hadn’t had a chance to put it on my mandrel yet to confirm actual arrival size.<br /><br />The great news is that it IS adjustable. When my husband pulled the ring sides outward and then I pushed the sides back in to fit my finger again, there was zero issue with chipping, flaking, or buckling nor was there any other negative effect. The only thing I don’t care for about adjustable bands on rings is that no matter how discrete and well-done the design, it still gets my hair caught in it when I try to put up a ponytail or run fingers through my hair. I’ve lost more than a few hairs to these types of rings. *grimace*<br /><br />The ring arrived with a very cool box and a polishing cloth. What it did not arrive with was a certificate of authenticity for the gem. I will be having it tested by my jeweler as soon as I can (as I have done with all the other Moissanite gems I have received). I’ll report back with an edit once I have a yay or nay from the jeweler.<br /><br />The ring box…. Even the ring box is a sight to behold. Very much a high quality jewelry store box. There’s a tiny LED in the lid that casts a glow on the gem to make it give a rainbow of sparkle immediately upon opening the box (see photos). The box color is a vibrant, bold, electric blue that has a shimmer to it. I honestly love the box nearly as much as the ring.<br /><br />Overall, I’d say this is a beautifully stunning, high quality gem that is worthy of a more high quality setting. I’m actually contemplating having a ring made and placing this RUISENT 1.0 Carat Moissanite gem into it. All of the little gems would find new homes in the new band as well. My scalp would thank me!

     Complete Text: It took me a minute to notice the spelling error on these socks. When I did finally see it I thought maybe it was some new slang word that I just wasn't familiar with. It's not. Now I see why the company didn't put accurate photos online.<br />Obviously the socks are supposed to say "I just wanna hang with my dog" but someone messed up big time and printed "hany" instead of hang.<br />It would be kind of funny if it wasn't so obvious that the company is trying to deceive buyers. These are referred to as "funny meme socks" but if you flip through the photos on Amazon you'll notice that they conveniently leave out the graphics and words. Most likely because if they were to show the actual product no one would buy it.<br />Other than that huge issue, the socks are decent. I wear a women's size 9 shoe and these fit me fine. The colors are bright and vibrant and I like the color scheme.<br />Unfortunately, I can only rate these 2 stars because of the spelling error and the way this company purposely deceives people.

     Complete Text: The bag is well constructed- I have used this to carry 8, 7' bass fishing rods with reels attached.  In addition, the extra storage pockets (2) hold line spools and as many as 5 baitcasting reels extra on the side pockets.  Understand that the length of this doens't accomodate full coverage or protection from crushing.  You can zip the rod slots all the way up to trap the rods in place with 3-4 ft. of all rods stowed exposed.  Zippers seem to be well made and work smoothly.  Material is heavier than I would have expected.  Got caught out in a rainstorm and got soaked Zippers are not water proof but I knew that to start with.  This is a great way to carry 6-8 rods when you need to fish from your partners boat and carry your gear.  You can get at least two rods/reels in each of the three zipper slots including spinning reel tackle.  you have to stagger the lay in the slots of course but it is roomy enough to do that. I feel like this was a great purchase after a tournament weekend outing- I was not disappointed at all!

     Complete Text: These pans are excellent, if you're a woman looking for shiny, satiny hip hugger pants for working the streets. However, for men's yoga pants, they missed the mark in a few areas.<br />1. THE SIZE IS WRONG --- These are NOT American large. Since there's so much stretch to the fabric, I can fit into them. However, my crotch and thighs are encased in skin tight satin. They ride very low on the hips.  The area from the crotch to the waist is very short, so they press up against my crotch. My package looks like it's going to burst out of the pants. Great for porn videos, not so great for around the house. They fit my legs, so the inseam is 28 inches. (I have REALLY short legs.) These are probably American men's size medium. (Or they're women's pants, which is what I think they are.)<br /><br />2. THE STYLE IS ALL WRONG -- How are these yoga pants? Yoga pants have a way to tie them around the ankles, so you can perform the inverted asanas. Since these are so lose, they're going to fall to the knees.  Because of the poor fit around the waist and crotch, any asana where you pull your legs apart, is going to further pull these down from your waist. The drawl string closure on the waist, is the only closure. But since the drawl string is really the same stretchy material as the pants, it doesn't really hold them on. The material is all wrong for yoga class obviously. (Or maybe all right, if you're a very good looking guy who wants to show off in a class of all super hot looking young women. But ONLY in that situation.) Real yoga pants are made from cotton canvas with 7% spandex, at least for men. Even if these did fit me, I wouldn't wear sheer satin pants in public. Really, they look like pajama bottoms.<br /><br />CONCLUSSION --- The only conceivable way a guy is going to wear these, is as pajama bottoms. Plus, he better be no taller than 5' 6&#34;, and wear a size 32-34 waist. And, he better have no parents, children, siblings, buddies, or basically anyone he doesn't want to look lascivious around, when he does wear them.  I would gladly have given these pants a five star review, however the product description just doesn't describe what these are.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional item for testing, examination and review purposes.

     Complete Text: Edit:<br />So I've had there for about a month and a half now. On top of the fact that 3 didn't screw on properly, I've had 3 balls break. 2 of them broke while I had it in. I felt something after I finished eating and when I pulled it out, it was the bottom ball. I picked it out and it fell apart in my hand. The 3rd one I noticed a crack from the hole to the center and that one fell apart. I know they were cheap, but I didn't think they would fall apart like that. Luckily I didn't swallow the bar and other ball when it broke!!!<br /><br />Well, what do you expect for $6.00?! I ended up with 6 that have skull and crossbones. And 3 don't screw on properly. I guess 23 that are good isn't too bad. I tried all to make sure the balls screw on OK. I had ordered the flexible ones several years ago and had the same issue. I have a lot of metal bars with acrylic balls, but the plastic is more gentle on teeth and I don't have to worry about taking it out every time I have an X-ray or MRI. Will edit my review if there are any more issues!

     Complete Text: This purse is super cute (red trim on 3 sides of front and back of bag with red handle and red shoulder strap - see stock photo of the bag I'm talking about attached to this review). However, even though the bottom of the purse is 5&#34; the opening zipper only opens to about 2.5&#34; wide, which makes it impossible to grab a wallet and put it out easily or even without scratching the back of your hand on the zipper.  Not nearly wide enough to open up and look into the bag to find what you need (ie sunglasses, phone, lipstick, pen etc.).  There also is a zippered interior compartment on the opposite side of the interior slip pockets (not mentioned in the description), however with the narrow top opening it is not possible to use this zip interior pocket at all unless you have VERY small hands (even my 11 year old could not reach in easily to the interior zippered pocket).  I was sad this particular style had such a poor design for functionality, because it truly, IMO, is the cutest purse in the line...I LOVED all the extra red!  I ended up with the other purse of a similar size from NAWO - still cute, a bit more golden & black accents; opening still tight/narrow, but I can get my wallet in an out of the one I kept, with much more ease.  Until they fix the top/zippered opening to open wider, I'd personally NOT recommend this bag.

     Complete Text: Please see the July 28, 2016 review posted by Terrence Craft.  His review is thorough and generally well done.<br /><br />My additional feedback:<br /><br />- Size.  The small/medium size I ordered fits like a large, and the circumference of the hat doesn’t match the expected size or fit.<br /><br />- Brim.  I own more expensive porkpie style hats, each of which have low cut brims that make the satin multi-colored band around the crown more prominent.  The height of the brim on this hat is too tall for a porkpie style hat.  I used a pair of shears to cut down the height of the brim so the satin multi-colored band is more prominent.  I posted a photo of my hat with the excess brim material that I trimmed off.<br /><br />- Re-Sized Fit.  I took the excess strip of brim material, trimmed it’s length down to fit the exact circumference of the hat, and then tucked the strip inside the hat’s sweat band and completely around the sweat band’s circumference to improve the fit.  This re-fit idea worked well and I now have a hat that fits properly.<br /><br />- Accessories.  Received the socks; no feather received, however.<br /><br />- Color.  The natural color is closer to a dark beige because the straw material has light tan graphics woven throughout the hat, which makes the overall color darker than the natural straw color I expected and preferred.<br /><br />- Quality. This is a well-made hat for the low price point.  I wasn’t worried about trimming off material from the brim to reduce its height because the hat’s material construction is well-stitched and strongly-fused with adhesive.<br /><br />I’d recommend this product despite the sizing and brim height issues (which lowered my rating) because it’s still a quality product for a low price.

     Complete Text: I'm a fan of a good sock. Especially when they don't leave harsh welts in the skin that are itchy and irritating at the end of a long day, when they are made of wool or other natural materials even better. I was offered this set of 5 Merino Womens Wool socks in color set A10 (at time of this review around $18) and thought  I would test them. For the purposes of this review I wear a size 10 in womens and have thinner calves.<br /><br />These socks upon first inspection are very nice! They are thick but not super thick all the way around (no extra padding in the footbed). Inside out there is a band just a bit below the "cuff" of the sock (see my inside out pic) that at first concerned me before I put them on. The socks themselves are 53% Merino, 24% Cotton 18% Polyester and 7% Spandex. They are machine washable and dryable (low)- made in China.<br /><br />I've worn a few pairs over days and here are my observations: they kept my feet warm and comfortable and the cuff did not fall. The band that concerned me in the end did not cause a problem and the socks left very light marks (see pic) on my legs. The colors are attractive and neutral. It's a nice medium weight winter sock that I have enjoyed wearing. The only thing one might need to be concerned with? Well, I'm a size 10 and these were just a little loose (NOT uncomfortably so)- so it makes me wonder since there is no sizing for these socks (one size for all?) that people with smaller feet might have issues with the sock being too big. Just a consideration! Otherwise I'm a fan, for 5 pairs of socks and this percentage of quality materials they are a good value.

     Complete Text: This is a large, sturdy women's wallet which is made of leather embossed with a basket weave design. It is not heavy, but the sides of it are thick and feel durable as there appears to be some sort of inner backbone in the wallet. This makes it hold its shape very well when you open it as well as keeps anything you put in it well-protected from bending or snapping. The exterior embossing adds interest to the design as well as prevents fingerprints from appearing on the surface. The stitching on mine was perfectly straight and secure with no stray threads or mistakes (not even on the rounded edges).<br /><br />The interior contains 8 dedicated card pockets and two long pockets. The center has a zippered compartment (ideal for coins) and an adjacent &#34;wall&#34; in which to put bills. The wallet is large enough to store American bills without folding. The exterior zipper keeps everything secure in the wallet even when it is very full. The zipper has a gold toned metal fob which makes the zipper easy to grab and pull. The exterior zipper is very smooth on mine and works easily which is somewhat surprising since it is a large teeth metal zipper and they can often be sticky by nature. The interior zipper is nylon and mine also functioned perfectly. Though the wallet is made out of leather, which often has a distinctive smell, my wallet had no odor whatsoever. This may be related to the &#34;breathable&#34; cloth mesh bag that it is shipped in allowing any leather processing chemicals to vent before it is received.<br /><br />This is a very nice wallet for someone who wants something which has a high capacity, sturdy build, and secure packaging for cards and cash. If you have issues with things falling out of your wallet, this is an excellent option.<br /><br />Note: I was given a free sample of this product for my assessment.

     Complete Text: A few years ago, when I first began to work at different summer camps I began to wear brightly colored trucker caps pretty much at all hours of the day. I did this because I like to upcycle them and make them fit my style, but it also helps with the Texas heat that was common in that area. I used to have a yellow trucker cap that I loved dearly but unfortunately due to excessive wear and tear I had to lay it to rest, after this I decided to start looking for a new cap to replace it and I eventually landed on this one. This cap was very good quality for what I paid for it and I loved the bright color of it as bright colors are typically something I'm attracted to. I put my own twist on it and added a smiley face on the back to make it a little more fun and it worked perfectly for what I was looking for. I wore that cap for quite a time and loved it dearly however it was a little thicker and bulkier than I had intended for it to be. The old yellow cap that I used to have fit my head perfectly and was rather malleable and this one didn't feel that way, and I didn't like that kind of feel as much. I personally thought that looked good backwards but I have never really thought of the trucker caps as good looking when they are worn in the proper way as they tend to pop up on the top of my head, but for me this is all trucker caps and not just this one in particular. It was a very good quality hat and after a few washes it tended to loosen up a little bit and work better, though it never got to be perfect. If you're looking for a trucker cap because its something you just like to wear or it's your style then by all means go for it but if you're just looking for a typical run of the mill cap than you might be more interested in a baseball cap rather than a trucker cap, but that is just my personal opinion.

I wear a med/large in most things and the XL fit in this dress... and expect it to be short.  The color on the website is the same as what was delivered.  It is a great bargain if you are younger or don't mind it being short.

I thought I'd try again with these because night glare is an issue for me. These glasses don't brighten my view, either, and they also turn everything yellow but the glare from oncoming headlights seems to be somewhat reduced. I've raised and lowered the glasses when it was safe to compare and there was some improvement with them on. The microfiber bag is very thin but will protect the lenses if not handled roughly. The more expensive, beyond-my-budget version yields better results but for the price, these are helpful.

The only issue I have with them is that the waist is 3-4 inches too big so they shift as I'm wearing them. Since I sew, I'll just be taking them in a bit (they fit well in the butt and thigh) but you may want to size down.

     Complete Text: I bought this belt for my son as he needed a good dress belt.  I love that it is a reversible belt too.  My son loves it as well, he said that he thinks it's great quality and sharp looking belt.  The only thing I would have changed which is my fault is; my son wears a size 34&#34; waist and I ordered a 36&#34;, however I should have ordered a size 38&#34;.  The belt fits him but only at the first hole, it doesn't allow for him to gain any weight and still wear it.  Had I have ordered the 38&#34; size it would have fit him with a lot more room to go up or down in weight.  Don't let my error stop you from ordering this belt, it is a very nice belt for the price.  Just make sure you order it a few weeks before you need it, as it took that long to arrive.<br /><br />I received this product at a great discount in exchange for an unbiased review of my experience(s) with this product.  As a consumer myself, I read and count on these reviews and ratings on whether to purchase a product or not.

     Complete Text: Love it! I had a breast augmentation and post surgery I'm a 32DD and wasn't sure it would fit because of other reviews, but the small fits me perfectly. It gave just enough compression while the implants were still high, and now that they are dropping, it feels even more comfortable (not so tight.) I can see if you have a wider frame, a small might be a bit tight, but if you're narrow, like me, a small will probably be a good fit.

The color unfortunately, is not complimentary to my skin tone. The color is listed as orange, but is more of a pumpkin color and while a nice color, it just did not look god on my darker skin. Due to this I'll have to send it back.Too bad, it's really lovely.

But it looks really cute.<br /><br />The color for the white and gray was disappointing, I thought I was buying white with gray which is shown in the picture but what I got was light gray with a slight darker gray.<br /><br />I have a lot of gray workout clothes so I was hoping to buy a white one, the picture shown is very deceiving & they should change it.<br /><br />I wanted to return it and buy a different white one from a different brand but I didn’t have time to do the return and I’m not terribly disappointed since it looks cute. I will just have to find another white one somewhere else.

When I got the package and opened it up to find 4 sets of 3 masks I was pretty surprised. Great price, the quality is good. The material is soft, breatheable, and a little stretchy (for my fat face, which is perfect). The ear loops are those stretchy bands with the rubber slider-adjusters which i love. Very comfy and easy to wear when you have to wear a mask. And now I can give some away to friends. Great deal just in time for Christmas.

My only two complaints, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are that I'm unsure of how the hem will hold up over time, it already seems to be pretty loose, so who knows, and also, I keep my nails relatively long and squared off, and when I would go to arrange the scarf around my neck or to take it off or move it, my nails snag the fabric easily and loosen it, so I have to be more careful! Other than those two things, this was a great buy!

Because she loves it, she wears it. I just try to not look directly at it or it will drive me crazy because it sits crooked and twisted looking. Also the adjustable head band is not very tight and automatically slips to the loosest setting.

     Complete Text: These earrings would be beautiful, however the back of them is designed in a way that makes them un-wearable. The spoke is so large around, anyone with a normal piercing cannot wear it. It also has a back that literally screws on and is is so small and delicate it's near impossible to get back on once you take it off out of of the packaging. And again, because the spoke is so large around, a normal earring back does not work, so no easy substitution option. Very disappointing.

I normally wear a L and XL and this fits me like an XL. The fabric is loose (not big). It comes down right above my belly button which i think is where it's supposed to. I wanted something more form fitting (maybe with a bit more spandex) to keep the girls in place..i have found that when i sleep it slides up and i'm exposed if you know what i mean. Overall, i like the shirts and can be worn in many different ways.

Because of that cheap material, I definitely don't think it was worth $30. I had a gift card which is the only reason I paid that much for it 😅  I'm wearing this once for Halloween, so it serves it's purpose perfectly for me. If you're planning to wear this on several occasions, I'm not sure I would recommend it because I think wear and tear would be an issue for sure. Definitely keep it in a safe place because I think it could be easily destroyed or smushed especially by a  kid or a pet!

In order to get &#34;no bounce,&#34; we are pretty much used to a tightness that hurts. I immediately wished I hadn't pulled the tags off so quickly.  But I went out for a four-mile run, and that thing worked! The bonus came when I finished and I didn't run to the bathroom to take it off.  For me, it fits true to fit. I purchased the DD size. I also enjoy the colors, and the price is very reasonable. I've paid more than three times this amount for other running bras that also doubled as torture devices. Try this one!

It’s as if the bottom part of it does t have elastic, so the “shoulder”/ top part is perfect, but if I raise my arms up, I’m completely exposed. This is definitely a hit or miss.

I had to cut it and add a jump ring and a new connecter because the lobster claw wouldn't close once it was opened. The elephants are going the wrong direction, they are attached to the back vertically instead of horizontally as they should be. Why? Why would you have them go on head to tail when they should be back to feet?

However, the material wasn’t what I expected either. The inside of the shirt was a slick satiny material. It felt cool against my skin. For a long sleeve shirt for cold weather, that’s not the feel I was going for.

It's not obvious from the photo, but mine came with two small chrome split rings; it's those rings that actually allow one or two keys to be attached to the key chain. The heavy chrome ring is actually too thick to permit sliding on of many late-model auto keys. Very pleased, will likely order another.<br /><br />Update: I did order a second one, this one with red leather. The red is a less pliable, smoother-grained, slightly higher gloss leather. Also, the chrome split rings for this one are larger. It was shipped in a throw-away pouch of some sort of netting. Different in some details from the first, it's still elegant and functional.

The cast-iron work isn't as polished nor well painted as you would expect with current cast-iron process.

The only negative comment would be that some glasses designs have ear pieces that are too slim to hold the elastic ends and therefore, slip-off frequently even though the tensioner band may be set to tighten the strap.

If I wear sandals all day I put them on when I get home and they feel so comforting and restoring.  I think wearing these all day and all night would be too much. maybe one or the other.  I have slept in them when I didn’t wear them all day and they somehow are NOT hot and keep my feet feeling cool!?m all day they feel great to sleep in and feel comforting on tired legs and feet. Highly reccomend!!! which is shocking as I cannot sleep in socks bc of our hot/humid climate.<br />9/22/2022 update<br />Still love these! And ordered a few more patterns. I also wear them on long hikes, bike rides and walks now. They have really held up well.  I do recommend air dry if you can to prolong the compression strength as high heat does deteriorate elastic type clothing. Once in a while they make the round in the dryer but I do my best to separate.

If you are a size 9 and like to have some room near the heel, these will not work.  If you like your feet right at the end you should be good to go.<br />I requested a return and the seller approved but be advised you will have to pay for the return shipping.

On the third use the latch completely tore off when attempting to close the bag (the bag only had my phone and charger in it when it broke). It's disappointing and I'm glad I didn't buy the bag in its other colors as I had originally wanted to, it's cute but unfortunately I won't buy again.

I can see the road clearly when I drive. The vision is broad. I have to say they are safe essentials. The most important is that they are stable and good-quality. I am confident that I can use them for quite a long period of time. Every material is carefully screening. I am very surprised at the material they use, comfortable and light. Buy one pair of glasses, I can also get sunglasses bag, sunglasses cloth, sunglasses cloth, all come in good quality. I like them very much. It is worth mentioning that the delivery is speedy so that I can wear this pair of glasses timely. The shipping service is good.

After all, it's a fashion mask, but at least I can still put my filter in, it just won't stay put but I can still use it.  Overall I like it.  Smelled bad when I opened it, so it got a quick wash,  dried super fast too.<br />Now it's not a value for the price, that's why it gets 4 stars.  I bought another one that's better for half the price.  I like this one, just the price is too high.  Won't be buying from them again, too pricy

No luck - it just doesn’t hang right, as if the fabric is twisted. Even worse, the sleeves are very narrow. They bind the upper arm, actually pinching around the armpit when you’re lying down - which makes sleeping uncomfortable.<br /><br />I have another one of these in the same size from the same vendor and it fits fine. The sleeves on the other one are noticeably wider and it is comfortable to sleep in. It’s really odd that one fits and the other doesn’t.

On one of the links the screw was already sticking out.  Tried to tighten it, wouldn't tighten.  Tried to remove it, wouldn't come out.  Luckily I have large but not huge wrists so I was able to remove the bad link, add in the ones that were previously removed, and it fit.  Also, the package did not come with the spring bars.  I cannibalized my old band and luckily the bars fit otherwise this band would have been useless.  As for the band, it is nice...seems to stick a little where the band attaches to the watch, but that may be because I had to put in my own spring bars.  Anyway, its a nice watch band, but the quality control is pretty poor for the cost of the product

But the sides, my hips-upper thighs, it created these weird bunches of fabric. I almost returned it, but in a stroke of genius I fastened a belt around my natural waist. It pulled the dress a bit more snug around my hips which did the trick - no more weird fabric bunches! If I could have ordered XS, I think I'd have given that a chance, but all that was available was Small. I'm 5'4, 125lbs, 32a-25-34 if that helps.

It’s small enough to fit in a locker and carries all the goodies I normally bring w/me. Unfortunately I can’t fit my HydroFlask 32oz in the outside pockets but it fits nicely inside. I’ll most likely order the next size up, mainly for the thicker strap.

They're great for simply changing to a different color filter for a while, but do very little for reducing halo effect from lights or making signs easier to read when glare is a factor. I will be going to my optometrist and having a real set of glasses crafted for me. I may use these frames if possible. They're reasonably comfortable and the lenses cover a great deal of usable vision space.

     Complete Text: I have large artisan pins that I’ve been waiting YEARS to wear as a proper pendant…I’ve used multiple products to no avail, but I’ve finally found a winner!<br /><br />The back disk spins to accommodate either a horizontal or vertical pin.  Also, of note, for your larger, heavier pins, you may have to use multiple converters so that the pendant doesn’t tilt or slide.<br /><br />I wear my pins on a silver slide collar and each one looks beautiful.  Additionally, the converters aren’t visible on any of my broaches, so the pendants appear to be suspended which is exactly the look that I’ve been looking for!<br /><br />Buy with confidence...

     Complete Text: First day out on the water, within 10mins, reached down in the boat and tore the inseam out! Had to fish the rest of the day with torn pants haha (plus I let the big one get away - what a day!). Anyway, they are light weight and extremely comfortable to wear- more comfortable than regular pants, somewhat waterproof, and just plain good fishing pants in terms of that.<br /><br />However, they are the least durable pants i own. This is because the crotch extends lower on these pants compared to my more expensive ones. This “slack” means it puts more pressure on the inseam when bending and twisting for lures and fish in your boat. DONT BUY, and if you decide to anyway, at least bring and extra pair of pants on the water with you!

When we tried to move the nose piece, it moved a little, but not enough. I will have to open the stitching and move the nose piece and restitch it. Another mask had a hole in the stitching, so I have to restitch that one as well. I was able to move one masks nose piece without issue. Not happy. If I wanted to do this much work, I would have made my own, honestly.

Didn't give five stars because when the right heart frame seemed to be further out towards my ear than the left, so not symmetrical which is definitely what i want in a pair of glasses, but since they are a bit flimsy i was able to bend the right frame down a bit for a more symmetrical look. Overall nice.

I'm about a 36C/D. I usually buy a medium for the bust and because my shoulders are a tad broad, but I'm glad I got the small based on other reviews as the medium would have likely been too long as I don't plan to wear it with super high heals. The fabric is stretchy on the top and the small doesn't feel at all tight. I like it enough to consider purchasing in another color.

The belt material was thick and nice, and the metal accents felt like real metal, with pretty scrolling, that wasn't blurry, or cheap.  I could not keep the belt, because the size was exact, meaning the largest inch on the size chart,  is the last hole on the belt. I thought it just looked bad on me, personally. The metal detail on the end of the belt, touched the metal loop, that I put the belt through, right after the buckle. So it was buckle, loop, belt end, all touching. It just didn't work for me. If you size up so you can use one of the first holes, it would be cuter, with space between the metal elements.

It was really wrinkled when it arrived so I washed in cold and let line dry according to instructions. That worked great to get out the wrinkles.  I wish I had noticed the pockets being sewn so far off before washing it though so I could return it. Otherwise it would have been a really cute dress.

     Complete Text: [[VIDEOID:c6f5c355af5253f65429142b3953dfc]] The color on the front is faded like I’ve had it for awhile. After wearing it twice the fabric is piling (little balls).<br />It’s super comfortable and fits great and was thinking of ordering another but the fabric is not holding up.

     Complete Text: I got these as Christmas presents for my 6-year-old twin girls and they seem to love them. Very soft and cozy. I'm giving it only 4 stars because the sizing is inconsistent. I bought two different colors in the same size and one is knee-length and the other is much longer. Also, one has a tie on the inside in addition to the belt, and the other does not.

     Complete Text: Band looked good. I wore it for a few weeks and got compliments.  Band is super easy to adjust because each link is a latch.  However, the latches came open easily.  Also, I had to disengage the password protection on the apple watch because if it was loose enough to be able to latch one handed (which seems  like a reasonable request of a watch band that you need to remove to charge every day), it would lose contact with skin and require re-entry of password.  Ultimately bought a new band because of the unlatching problem.  I was worried I would lose or break watch.

     Complete Text: I received a great dupe. I was a little concerned because the image changed several times after I purchased mine but  I received a bag with the correct labels, even on the embellishments. It literally had everything of the original, just not the high-quality leather. Came with a dust bag and mini clutch, both labeled. The mini clutch had 2 of the logos placed incorrectly and the dust bag had a little scuff on a letter but no one will ever see that but me. Other than those two flaws it actually looks like the real bag.
