4.0,"Great Sandal, Leather Must be Broken In","Ok, so I ordered the Reef Phantoms on here a while ago, and they were the most comfortable flip-flop I've ever owned to date. I went a half size up from my shoe size; 8.5 to 9, because I read sandals should be a size larger than your shoe.  They fit perfectly to say the least.  Then I had my brother order these for me, and I just received them yesterday.  I got the white and brown because they are just stylin'; what can I say?  What I did not expect is the leather is pure rawhide leather!  Awesome flip-flops, but rough leather on the top of my feet with no socks is pretty uncomfortable.  I think once these are broken in they will end up being my favorite sandals ever.  The leather actually grips my toes and feet a little better than the synthetic material on the Phantoms, so mainly its a matter of getting used to the chafing on the top of my feet (the only reason I gave these four stars instead of five,) and wearing the leather down to a softer texture for more walking comfort.  On top of that, judging by the durability of these (finer stitching, better molding, etc.,) these will probably last 5+ years where I think I'll be lucky to get 3 years out of the Phantoms.  All in all, I love Reef sandals, and as soon as I get used to these, they will be five stars to me.",B001PTHDHS,B001PTHDHS,AGIP2AQ3POQIGSKHV7FWC6KGYV3A,1308977955000,2,False

I also wear them on long hikes, bike rides and walks now. They have really held up well.

5.0,"Nice socks! Stays up, no heavy marks. Smaller footed persons be aware....(w/pics)","I'm a fan of a good sock. Especially when they don't leave harsh welts in the skin that are itchy and irritating at the end of a long day, when they are made of wool or other natural materials even better. I was offered this set of 5 Merino Womens Wool socks in color set A10 (at time of this review around $18) and thought  I would test them. For the purposes of this review I wear a size 10 in womens and have thinner calves.<br /><br />These socks upon first inspection are very nice! They are thick but not super thick all the way around (no extra padding in the footbed). Inside out there is a band just a bit below the ""cuff"" of the sock (see my inside out pic) that at first concerned me before I put them on. The socks themselves are 53% Merino, 24% Cotton 18% Polyester and 7% Spandex. They are machine washable and dryable (low)- made in China.<br /><br />I've worn a few pairs over days and here are my observations: they kept my feet warm and comfortable and the cuff did not fall. The band that concerned me in the end did not cause a problem and the socks left very light marks (see pic) on my legs. The colors are attractive and neutral. It's a nice medium weight winter sock that I have enjoyed wearing. The only thing one might need to be concerned with? Well, I'm a size 10 and these were just a little loose (NOT uncomfortably so)- so it makes me wonder since there is no sizing for these socks (one size for all?) that people with smaller feet might have issues with the sock being too big. Just a consideration! Otherwise I'm a fan, for 5 pairs of socks and this percentage of quality materials they are a good value.",B07ZVBNGV2,B07ZVBNGV2,AHCEDKGE26XM7BF3R6FST5FH6K4A,1578532276894,0,False

Luckily I have large but not huge wrists so I was able to remove the bad link, add in the ones that were previously removed, and it fit.  Also, the package did not come with the spring bars.  I cannibalized my old band and luckily the bars fit otherwise this band would have been useless.  As for the band, it is nice...seems to stick a little where the band attaches to the watch, but that may be because I had to put in my own spring bars.

3.0,Im not in love.,I am 5'9 size 12/14. I ordered an XL. It fits fine in the chest (Im DDD). But the dress is slightly too short. It hits right at my ankles. Its also see through.

I may exchange for a darker color (I ordered the light blue with orange chevron). I also don't really like the spandex material. It holds a lot of static.

(I had read a review that expressed the blouse must come in doll sizes, and at that moment I knew what they were speaking.) However, something told me to still 'try' to try it on. And I am so glad I did! This has easily become one of my favorite fancy/elegant blouses to wear. I am so fond of it that I have now ordered the other color it is available in. Such a great price for such a lovely piece. I am very pleased!",B00PDK9K62,B00PDK9K62,AFSQEGCFMPJSJ4F3AMDHZXJ4ZBMQ,1450942028000,0,True

He didn't realize why it seemed to be tighter and wore it in the pool again.  That time it got so tight he could no longer wear it.

These ended up being bulkier than I had expected but I like that they take up a little more space.  For me it makes it easier to find them if I'm feeling around in a pack, easier to grab them, and also with them being a little bigger it allows more bright blue to be seen when I'm looking for them.

The stitching and construction all feel very solid and substantial. However, that being said I would still probably hand wash or wash on gentle to prolong the life. The flower looks more peachy pink to me in person and not so pink pink, it is very cute! the pattern on the material is very cute and matches the picture perfectly. I actually think the outfit is way cuter than these sales pictures depict.

4.0,Okay BUT REALLY 3 1/2 STARS,"(DISCLAIMER THE IPHONE 13 PRO MAX IS MINE AND ONLY USED AS A TOOL FOR DEMONSTRATION.)<br />PROS:  The seems would seem to be nicely stitched. Easy to clean. Nice interior with a satin feeling material. Hardware seems to be sturdy and of a adequate material. Holds a LOT. Light weight enough. Can be put on shoulder or held, comfort level would depend on how much was being held in tote/handbag/purse. Has more than enough pockets/pouches a total of six, one outside zipper and two open as well on the outside. On the inside are three more two open little ones and one large zippered one. It also came with a dust cover.<br /><br />CONS: On the outside front on both sides the piping/braiding is short. Just my opinion but it looks off and would have been better without it or better to have it reach bottom to the tip of the beginning of the handle/strap. Next on the outside  still the zippered pocket/pouch is wide enough but not very deep at all I tried to get a good picture of the measurement. Still on the outside the side pockets/pouches here could have had acouple of alterations or leave offs done in my opinion and would have made it looked finished or maybe even  upped the look of the tote/handbag/purse, the material on the pockets/pouches is just flipped and looks sewn on bottom and side. My opinion it would have looked more finished if the top had been sewn or even I hate to say glued, to give it a flat look or just left off all together. Now to the top the outside zipper you have a tab to hold on to at either end and my worry is they are going to just rip off. In the pictures I had only lifted them to look at the underlying stitch and as you see they started tearing immediately. So with that I would be so very careful with those pieces. Now inside the two open pockets/pouches are so so small and not deep. I think I fitted my small rescue inhaler and one lip balm in one and they didn't stay in for long. I just know I either couldn't fit or keep it in. The lining inside has so much extra material it bunches up and you can lose things or it will possibly snag easier and rip. That's just my opinion.  The "" DUST BAG"" feels like thinned out cheap felt. It was a waste of money that could have been used somewhere else.<br />This for me isn't a go to tote/handbag/purse. I feel like it was trying to be something it's not and went to cheap and maybe to fast instead of going about it differently. But once again all this has just been my opinion. I was generous by giving it a 4 star I would have giving it 3 1/2 if I could. I hope this has been helpful in someway, Please let me know below.

2.0,Satin Stretch Pajama Bottoms -- American size Medium.,"These pans are excellent, if you're a woman looking for shiny, satiny hip hugger pants for working the streets. However, for men's yoga pants, they missed the mark in a few areas.<br />1. THE SIZE IS WRONG --- These are NOT American large. Since there's so much stretch to the fabric, I can fit into them. However, my crotch and thighs are encased in skin tight satin. They ride very low on the hips.  The area from the crotch to the waist is very short, so they press up against my crotch. My package looks like it's going to burst out of the pants. Great for porn videos, not so great for around the house. They fit my legs, so the inseam is 28 inches. (I have REALLY short legs.) These are probably American men's size medium. (Or they're women's pants, which is what I think they are.)<br /><br />2. THE STYLE IS ALL WRONG -- How are these yoga pants? Yoga pants have a way to tie them around the ankles, so you can perform the inverted asanas. Since these are so lose, they're going to fall to the knees.  Because of the poor fit around the waist and crotch, any asana where you pull your legs apart, is going to further pull these down from your waist. The drawl string closure on the waist, is the only closure. But since the drawl string is really the same stretchy material as the pants, it doesn't really hold them on. The material is all wrong for yoga class obviously. (Or maybe all right, if you're a very good looking guy who wants to show off in a class of all super hot looking young women. But ONLY in that situation.) Real yoga pants are made from cotton canvas with 7% spandex, at least for men. Even if these did fit me, I wouldn't wear sheer satin pants in public. Really, they look like pajama bottoms.<br /><br />CONCLUSSION --- The only conceivable way a guy is going to wear these, is as pajama bottoms. Plus, he better be no taller than 5' 6&#34;, and wear a size 32-34 waist. And, he better have no parents, children, siblings, buddies, or basically anyone he doesn't want to look lascivious around, when he does wear them.  I would gladly have given these pants a five star review, however the product description just doesn't describe what these are.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional item for testing, examination and review purposes.",B01BGLLCV2,B01BGLLCV2,AF54E46D5UB7ATY4RUYY7DZIE7QQ,1475283343000,1,False

It definitely doesn't hug anything, but I like how it looks on me so much better.  One thing I really like about this jumper is that it's not too long for a short person like me.  I can wear flats or high shoes and I don't have to worry about torn or dirty legs because the bottoms drag the ground.  If your body dimensions are larger in one area or the other, I'd recommend ordering your regular size.  If you're tall or a medium-tall height, then this romper may show more ankle or fit more like crop pants.",B07DLTRGXG,B07DLTRGXG,AFBODWCOHDV4NH6ENEWC5DIMFX6Q,1541475352485,7,True

Because the gift boxes are made from paper, adhering the product SKU tag directly on the gift box is not a great approach.

Another protective sleeve surrounds the gift box and that would have been the better place to adhere the tag.

It also had a zip pocket in the back, which I didn't notice in the description and for aerial stuff I'd be a little concerned it would catch and tear the aerial fabric. I think when I did the bend over test in these, I was just barely able to see my bright underwear through it. These pants would probably be good for other activities.

When the straps are shortened and he is wearing shoes they are great.<br /><br />The fabric is thick and feels durable. The stitching appears solid. These seem so far like good quality overalls that will last.<br /><br />The seller (I know people complain when people talk about this but it was important for us in making this purchase) Dave's big and Tall sent them right away I ordered on a Sunday night and received them Thursday.

It's pretty short not to wear with anything under, but not so short that I haven't work without something under. The sleeves of the dress are definitely loose like in the picture. Also, this will only look like the picture if you have NO chest. I have plenty of chest, so this is fitted more around the upper area and tummy. I do like that it's a light material because I get warm easy. I have noticed that after machine washing twice it's gotten really soft.

They are MUCH cooler design than those offered to people in the military & they dry incredibly fast. In the military, time is of the essence. With a couple shakes & a quick wipe down (nothing too specific) the sandals are dry & able to be stored neatly in his locker. The sandals are really lightweight. I gave these a 4 over a 5 star because 1) the smell isn't fabulous upon opening but again, it DOES TRULY go away within a couple days & 2) the grip on the bottom, while good, is not great.

5.0,Flexible Scarf,"This rayon scarf is so light and airy. At 30 inches wide by 50 inches long, plus four inches of fringe at each long end, I have plenty of fabric to work with when deciding how to wear it.<br /><br />I ordered the teal, which my camera translated to a thoroughly gray color - admittedly it's got a bit more gray than my monitor color showed, but not much. It's really a lovely, soft, ocean-on-a-cloudy-day, blue.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it feels like a Pashmina, or cashmere, myself - the weave is too light. It does feel delicate and soft. Great to wear as a scarf and then pull over your head on those days when you suddenly need head/hair cover. It's not a thick fabric, so although there's enough for a sarong or skirt, I'm wearing a bathing suit underneath.

4.0,"GORGEOUS, SILKY, LOVELY...","Okay, so I did really love this robe...until I put it on. It is gorgeous, lightweight and oh-so silky, but just a little too small for me. I have to say that I happen to have a very large chest area. However, all other things that I purchase that is XL works just fine. If not for that, I would not have mentioned it. Perhaps mine was mismarked, I do not know. All I know for certain is that it does not work well over my ample chest. It is a decent enough length, but it doesn't close over my chest. I live in Florida, so I was thrilled to have this beautiful, lightweight option. Perhaps as I keep getting smaller--but still, my chest doesn't really ever go away. My advice for anyone who wants a lovely, lightweight robe is to Size up--if you happen to be a woman that is more well endowed up top. As for the length, if you are above average height, it will not be as long as you think either. Overall, I still think it is gorgeous, I just may give it to my (not so well-endowed) daughter. Maybe. Otherwise, I will just keep it to wear because it is so silky.<br /><br />Excellent seller! Super fast shipping! I got mine with TWO DAYS with Prime!! Excellent communication and follow-up as well, THANK YOU!!<br /><br />I did receive this product for free, in exchanged for my unbiased review. However, please note that I live by the Golden Rule. When I come to Amazon to buy products (nearly daily) I rely on reviews often. I want to know what I am reading is accurate (as you can clearly tell by this review). That is how I offer my reviews. While a lot of sellers on Amazon prefer to see their reviews right after a product is received, I take a few days to fully try out the products. If I like what I see, I say so.

4.0,Nice for Summer,"I ordered this dress for my teen daughter. She loves to wear dresses in the summer months and this one is perfect for that. My daughter is 5'7&quot; and weighs about 130 pounds. She wears a medium to large in junior sizes and a small to medium in misses. I went by the measurements provided and selected a medium. We may have been able to get by on a small, but her cup size is a C and we have found that many dresses are too tight in that area. This one fits well on her. The length is long, but not to the floor. My picture doesn't show how long it is in on her, but it is similar to the model in the picture. The straps are adjustable. It requires a strapless bra to be worn. The dress itself is a basic, cotton knit dress. It flows nicely and hangs well. The quality is in the mid range. There were a few loose threads, but the seams are good.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.

5.0,This shoe is worth the money!!!!!,"These shoes are awesome!  I suffer from sciatica and have been on the hunt for a shoe that helps, or at the very least doesn't make it worse.  I was very skeptical to try a shoe online without trying them on first, especially with the price, but based on the other reviews, I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />The first time I tried them on, they felt like they were tailor made for my foot.  I know that sounds weird, but so many times I try on a shoe and you have to wiggle and jiggle to get it to fit right.  These fit right off the bat.  The true test was when I would stand and walk for any length of time.  They still felt great and over time, I'm able to walk longer distances without as much pain.<br /><br />One of the best features of this shoe is that the laces tighten very easily.  So many shoes now days you have to tighten each row up the shoe, but this shoe is made so that you pull the laces and all the eyeletts tighten at once.  It's like how the shoes used to be.  They stay tight all day long (you don't have to retie them 1/2 way through the day).  They are a good style and they have a nice weight to them.  They aren't too heavy, but they aren't feather light either.<br /><br />Since I'm so happy with these shoes, I'm going order another pair so that I have an alternate.  I'm also going to check out the other styles (maybe tennis shoes).  If you are waffling about whether to spend the money for an orthotic type shoe, I highly recommend you do.",B003OG3Z2C,B003OG3Z2C,AGSCB7MHIBVX6JVOWUJQZIFPOZHQ,1437232607000,20,True

These were actually comfortable to walk in, and were comfortable overall.  The toes fit nicely which was nice, since I have tried other brands where the toes were too short.  The only downfall, and unfortunately the most important thing for a pair of Yoga socks, is the fact that they won't stay on your feet during Yoga practice.  This actually created unsafe situation in most of the Yoga moves.  So, if you want a pair of socks, that are comfortable, that you can maybe wear around the house, these might be nice.

3.0,"Run 1-2 sizes too small, long fingers, stiff material","Narrow, run small, fingers are far too long and there is minimal flexibility in these gloves. I’m a pretty big guy (6’1” 225 pound weightlifter) and I would need a XXXL for anywhere near a comfortable fit. I used the sizing chart and it’s a waste of time - my hands are 9.25 inches around according to the chart  the XL souls fit me - not even close. For $8 I’ll keep them but they are hard to get on my hands - better suited for women or guys with small hands. There’s a joke here but I’ll pass.<br /><br />Bottom line is that If you have small hands, order 1-2 sizes larger and if you have big hands, keep looking for a better sized pair of gloves. They do work on touch screen phones but they are so stiff it’s hard to have any dexterity when using a phone.",B07YWF6P6G,B07YWF6P6G,AELEQ2KCIH7LLI32UKH4B447HQKA,1576967130427,0,False

I prefer a darker colored silver rather than the high polished look this one arrived with, but that's pure preference. Seemed to give it a slightly discolored appearance when it first arrived, although since I wear my rings nonstop, it's starting to even out a little. Overall I will still keep wearing it, most likely as long as it holds up well.<br /><br />***FOLLOW UP - changing to one star since ring actually broke shortly after I posted this review.

5.0,Love it. Fit well.,"This mask has great potential for my puposes. It is sturdy and solid. Mine had no air bubbles in the cast and all of the stiches are molded nicely and well painted. However my plan is to scrape off the stitches as I am going as comic cat woman and not Michelle Pfeiffer catwoman.<br />this mask is definitely molded for one size of head. I'm not sure how to measure this, but if you are in doubt about whether or not it will fit, it fits me pretty well, so here are some of my measurements:<br /><br />Circumference, parallel to the ground, around my forehead:<br />21.5&#34;<br /><br />Circumference round my face, in front of the ears, to under my chin:<br />22.5&#34;<br /><br />I hope that helps at all.<br /><br />The chin strap on this mask is strange though. It is as if the stap is supposed to go on your chin as opposed to under it.<br />the angle of it is weird, and because of this I might cut it off.<br />The left eye hole I'm this mask seems larger than the right.<br />This mask has a keyhole cut into the back, so that you can get it on. My plan is to put holes in this so that I can lace it shut, but it doesn't gape open on my head or anything.<br />also molded into the back of the cowl are the words &#34;MADE IN CHINA&#34; and &#34;C 2014 DC COMICS Inc&#34;<br />They easily could have put this on the inside.

So, my husband normally wears a Large size and this fits him well (he's slim), except it's on the lengthier side at the waist- he's 5'11"" so this may be slightly long on you if you're under his height, since he found it about an inch or so too long. He was surprised at the immediate warmth, and since it's still warmish weather here, he took it off, but said that he'd like to wear this in the winter.  The outer shell is a good quality cotton sweater w ribbed cuffs, neck and waist, and the fluffy fur is sewn in like a very well-fitted liner- so well-fitted, i had to double check that it wasn't just attached to the outer sweater directly via adhesive or something like that (it's not).

I have not had a single issue.<br /><br />Looks - I love the way it looks on my fitbit.  I bought the black, and the two go together so well in terms of finish that yo would swear the band was made by fitbit.<br /><br />Ease of installation - Simple and straightforward.  I didn't even look at the instructions.  It's really not hard at all to figure it out on your own.  Took less than two minutes.<br /><br />Price - I don't think it is too high for the quality of product you are getting.<br /><br />Overall - I am very satisfied with this band.  I don't have anything other than the stock band to compare it to, so take that for what its worth, but if this one broke, I'd definitely purchase another one.<br /><br />If you were to press me to say one bad thing about this band I would have to say that at first I was concerned about the little levers on the very first links that connect the band to the pieces that fit into the fitbit.

I am normally a 38 f and I ordered a 40 g well I could hook it together it was quite tight and very uncomfortable and the cups seemed to extend in a strange v outward, there was no support and seemed loose in the cups",B073J9YN5L,B073J9YN5L,AFU2DUV5GNZ664LWIYPV3XROSNKQ,1571014344116,0,True

2.0,Kind of close...,"A little too loose and maybe a tad too short in the waist (like I felt I wanted to pull them up a little higher but couldn't).  Waist was too loose but then the calves were too snug.  So I felt like I'd be constantly pushing down the pant leg because if I bent or sat, the leg would creep up a bit and get stuck.  I feel I have pretty small calves or least right for the size I'm ordering.  So to have the waist be loose and calves too tight made these a miss.  Kind of cute and I think I would have liked them and kept them if they fit properly.  I felt they did have give in the fabric despite being lined, but alas, no go.",B00R3STZFS,B00R3STZFS,AHRX3CKUBMI3UEXNE4HWADQRGIGQ,1567990048117,1,True

4.0,"Nice and comfortable, maybe a little pricey for this style","I needed some ""basic work"" pants for the summer, so I ordered these without hesitation.  The pants themselves are very comfortable, and offer plenty of room without causing one to be mistaken for M.C. Hammer.<br /><br />As far as the style, they are definitely of the ""casual"" variety,  and depending on your workplace dress code, you may not get away with wearing them.<br /><br />But if you're just getting around, handling your business, or looking for some good pants that are both good for relaxing and manual labor, then these are good.<br /><br />The fabric is also quite comfortable, without being too thin.  They are also quite breathable, which is a good thing for the summer.<br /><br />The only real downside is that some may find $29.99 to be a little pricey for the kind of pants that you could likely find at the thrift store for a fraction of the price.  Then again, if you don't care about cost, and want some roomy, comfy pants, then look no further.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.",B09QSRS48X,B09QSRS48X,AG3KCDEBTFSRSJVZHXO4H6B6NBYQ,1652204002723,2,False

The cloth feels good against the skin for all day comfort wrapped or other wise.<br />The tassels at the bottom as just a bit of flair without being gaudy or in the way if you do tactical or functional wrapping.<br />Perfect for people that have slightly larger heads and necks.

I would certainly buy another one of these hats and recommend it to others.

5.0,I LOVE this outfit,"I got the 0-3 month size as a baby shower gift and was sad to give it away when he grew out of it. I found the 3-6 size on Amazon and ordered it. The material is soft against the baby's skin. Frequently I find soft fuzzy outfits are soft on the outside for the people holding the baby to enjoy, but regular feeling or even scratchy against the baby. The colors are vibrant and the material did not get pills (a pet peeve of mine). There is a version of this with a zipper. I hunted for the snapping version of it because zippers buckle up on little babies and make them think they are about to be fed when it brushes against their mouth. Even though the weather is getting warmer, I wanted to have one warm fuzzy fleece outfit for my son in case I was going someplace with him when I knew it would be cold out, like my older son's evening baseball games.",B005HR0LO6,B005HR0LO6,AEOLWELSEIXLNRXZYCFTMCS6OPWQ,1335545653000,1,True

3.0,FABULOUS!  but also a pain!,"These are by far the best-fitting, best-looking pants I own.  Unfortunately, they require a LOT of special care which I am likely to screw up sooner rather than later.  First of all, the warning is that they must be laid flat to dry.  Remembering not to put them in the dryer with all the other clothes is the first challenge.  Secondly, I &#34;laid them flat&#34; to dry - really hung them on a hangar - two days ago and they are still wet.  It will take another two days, at least, for them to air dry.  The next problem is they require ironing.  Who irons anymore??  Hopefully, I will find my ironing board in the garage and the iron somewhere in a closet.  I am hoping a way can be found to maintain the excellent look and wear-ability of these pants but also to reduce the upkeep.  I now purchased a size bigger and the regular - rather than than the short - length.  I am going to wash and put them in the dryer, hoping they will come out just right.  Definitely a step in the right direction though. (BTW, please don't suggest I have the dry cleaned.

5.0,Best pair of glacier glasses EVER!  These are awesome.,"This is my 5th pair of these glasses.  (3 Matt Black and 2 Nickel (Silver))  I LOVE THEM!  The leather sides block out ambient light that reflects back into your eyes with normal sunglasses.  Some think the design is a bit dated, but I like the large round lenses.  Very easy to see out of.  These are great for all types of activities except for driving.  You must really turn your head all the way around to get a good view of what's beside you before changing lanes.  They hold up really well.  I was very tough on the first pair.  The 2nd pair I took much better care of and gave them to my son.  I lost the next pair and bought a couple more recently to replace them.  They are VERY hard to find because they have been discontinued, at least in the U.S. as far as I can tell.  The nose piece has to be worked on a little for comfort.  Also, on the last pair, I had to adjust the side rails.  But compared to other glasses... never mind, there is no comparison.  These are awesome!!!",B01N94BZW0,B01N94BZW0,AHO23I7JGOHAVL5JCEV6ESJQTS5Q,1503372534031,1,True
4.0,"Pretty dress, okay quality, sizing is a little weird. Sheerness of fabric makes a slip necessary.","This dress is beautiful, BUT-two caveats. 1-fabric is thin and it requires a slip of some kind since it is not lined at all. It’s also kind of cheaply made, loose strings here and there, but the print is lovely, and the wrap-around design is nice. 2. The sizing on this is weird. The small is a little too small. I feel like my boobs are putting so much strain on the fabric that it’s about to bust at the seams, and the slit in the front is too revealing, plus it’s shorter than I’d like (I’m 5’7”). The medium is a perfect length and the skirt wraps well so I don’t have any issues with a revealing slit, but the bust is loose no matter how I wrap it, so my boobs are falling out. It requires a camisole for the sake of modesty. And again, the sheerness....Overall this is a pretty dress and if you wear it with the right undergarments and in the right size, not expecting it to be something that will last the rest of your life, it will work.",B07RL6F9S7,B07RL6F9S7,AH5DG7UFGD5AUAONFCGNSN5YIHHA,1566485151043,0,True

5.0,Very Nice. It is Well Made. I am buying a second one.,"My new emergency bracelet is pretty darn cool. I bought this for my son but now I'm thinking about getting one for myself. The bracelet itself is made of paracord. So if anything ever happened and I needed rope for some reason, I'd have it. It also came with a compass and there is also a small cutting device on the latch along with a safety whistle. My son is going to be thrilled to get this. He has been wanting one for some time. We were at the county fair and there were vendors set up with a table selling something similar. Not exactly the same but they were similar and they wanted a lot more money for theirs and they weren't as nice as this one. Now that I've had a chance to really look this over good I can set where it would look be beneficial to have one with me on my fishing and hunting trips. You just never know what might happen and it's good to be prepared. I will feel better prepared wearing one of these. Plus they look pretty darn cool as well which is a bonus. I am happy that I bought this for my son, now I have to go buy a second one for me. I hope you found this information useful to you and thank you for reading.<br /><br />Click &#34;Yes&#34; if you found this helpful.

I put them out on the clothes line for over a month now.  Rain, sun and wind has helped slightly.  I just took them down and washed 2 more times.  The smell is still there but will try them later this week and hopefully no problem.  I have compression socks that are very similar I purchased from another manufacturer on amazon.  They even have same patterns and colors as 2 pairs of these calf sleeves.  They never had any odor what so ever.  I should have returned them immediately.

5.0,Roomy & Comfortable T-Shirt,"On the roomy side, this t-shirt is comfortable and cute. The crew neck fits perfectly, not too loose or too tight. I like that its drop-sleeves are loose and on the longish side, allowing a lot of air to flow around my upper arms and a bit more sun protection on the arms. I wear this in the garden on warm days, but it is cute enough to wear out to a casual lunch or dinner. Made of synthetic material (polyester, spandex & rayon), it is relatively soft and has some stretch to it, which adds to its comfort level.  It is well constructed and sewn, without a single loose thread. The seams & hem are well fortified. I really like the blue color, a sort of cornflower or periwinkle blue.<br /><br />The directions indicate that the t-shirt should be washed in cold water and hung to dry. I wash it in cool water and tumble dry it on low, but I pull it out of the dryer when it is still damp; then I hang it up to finish drying. This prevents shrinkage & wrinkling.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this relaxed oversized t-shirt. It's well made and a good deal at its current ($15) price point.

I have sensitive ears and they did not bother my ears.  They are slightly heaver then a normal stud earring.  The look is beautiful.

Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, teachers, coaches, principal, boyfriend and friends alike absolutely RAVED over the dress!!!  Her Spanish teacher called me a couple days later to discuss an assignment but the first thing out of her mouth was &#34;that's an amazing dress, where did you get it?&#34;  And she was shocked at how little it cost.<br /><br />The material of the dress was way beyond expectation for the price.  It's a sturdy, non-see-though yet super silky to the touch, though I'd say it's more of a satin material.  Trust me, despite whatever low reviews you see, this is a quality dress.  If your big chested you may have a problem with it, but I'd say order slightly bigger than what you may think if that's the case, OR, if you're curvy.

2.0,"Cute bag, really poor functinality!","This purse is super cute (red trim on 3 sides of front and back of bag with red handle and red shoulder strap - see stock photo of the bag I'm talking about attached to this review). However, even though the bottom of the purse is 5&#34; the opening zipper only opens to about 2.5&#34; wide, which makes it impossible to grab a wallet and put it out easily or even without scratching the back of your hand on the zipper.  Not nearly wide enough to open up and look into the bag to find what you need (ie sunglasses, phone, lipstick, pen etc.).  There also is a zippered interior compartment on the opposite side of the interior slip pockets (not mentioned in the description), however with the narrow top opening it is not possible to use this zip interior pocket at all unless you have VERY small hands (even my 11 year old could not reach in easily to the interior zippered pocket).  I was sad this particular style had such a poor design for functionality, because it truly, IMO, is the cutest purse in the line...I LOVED all the extra red!  I ended up with the other purse of a similar size from NAWO - still cute, a bit more golden & black accents; opening still tight/narrow, but I can get my wallet in an out of the one I kept, with much more ease.

I'm 5'6&#34; and the top falls just beneath the bottom of the panty in front. The bottoms are a little loose on me but that's only because I normally wear a size 8 on the bottom.

The buttons are just sewn on the front, they're not functioning buttons. This reminds me of a night gown that would be worn in the 1800's or something.

5.0,True to Description,"I just received these yesterday. I wore them for about 4 hours yesterday and at this writing I've been working on my computer for six hours. They REALLY DO block the blue light. My eyes don't feel as strained after these periods of time. They also block the brightness of the sunshine coming in the window in my office. That was unexpected but welcome.<br /><br />In terms of fit, they are secure to my head. I can get up and move to another room to get a cup of coffee or make my lunch and they don't move around or fall off.  Some people may find the springs a little tight. They don't bother me at all but if someone has a larger head they might be a problem. I am interested to see how much, if any, they loosen up.<br /><br />The style is decent. I like the colors and the larger lens size which I need while working at a computer all day. That said I wouldn't choose the shape for regular glasses to wear around town. But for reading glasses it's fine and the price is excellent.  I would definitely buy them again and probably will in the future.",B073DDNYQG,B079RMS9ZG,AG52YFVSRFSRVSFRLEVTYH4AV52Q,1594589725539,1,True

3.0,Doesn't Match The Product Description,"Once I figured out how to make it work it is ok and looks nice on the hat. A couple things to note: First; the band I got does not attach to itself. No hook or velcro. It is simply a ""ribbon"" with a bow attached at one end. On mine the inside of the bow had was open so I could fold the other end into a point of sorts and push it thru the bow. Do this first and pull the end just enough to get it to stay. Then put it on the had and position it how you want and the proceed to tighten it up on the hat. Once you get it how you want then I guess you could use a needle and thread to tack the free end to the bow end to keep it from coming apart. Second issue is that mine came folded so it has fold creases. You should be able to iron those out before you attempt to attach it to the hat. This was a bit more work than I had anticipated. I  wish  the seller had included a more accurate description of the item and included some instructions.",B07515TSVR,B07515TSVR,AFPUIV7IASAABDJWI4AHZ44BGIYQ,1612064159191,1,True

I like this because it permits the large flowing sleeve openings while being placed above the wrist makes it less likely for the sleeves to accidentally drag in anything while eating or drinking.  The robe stays securely closed for there's an inner tie as well as a belt.  There are 2 belt loops - one of each side of the robe.  I like the deep front pockets on each side of the robe.  A nice touch is at the bottom on either side of the robe, there is an opening about 10 inches high on either side.  It's an opening and not a slit for there are connecting threads at the hem although I wouldn't be surprised if they get caught and tear open.  I've already been caught by this opening on a piece of furniture.  The satin feels smooth and cooling on my skin.

4.0,"Just so-so in design, it'll do for now while waiting for better","Ehh.. I guess it will do and I will use for now but.. wish it had a couple of hidden pockets underneath the cardholders with side entries like many other wallets. It is very simple and not many card slots though it has plenty of room for another card panel to have been inserted since the large zippered body allows for more volume but the space is not utilized well.😕 A newer non-plus sized phone with a phone case does not fit well in front pocket as I've had to force mine and work at stretching out closure flap in order for phone to fit. I'm sure that's what most people wish to do with the front pocket, is put their phones in it.. they should've made the pocket a quarter to half inch longer🙁 The width of the pocket it fine, it's the length that needs work. I was hoping to get this in black but so far, I've only seen the two oddly tinted colors offered. I chose the purple which is not an eggplant or plum that I hoped for according to pics and reviews, but is is rather a brownish with a wine/burgundy tone. So far, Stronghold RFID Wallets are the most protected according to tests and many reviews and the men that I know usually use Stronghold brand so I wanted something protective for me as well therefore I purchased one and chose this particular wallet for the pocket for my phone and the zippered enclosure as well as it being a wristlet. I will use and keep this for the time being but hopefully Stronghold will take these design issues into consideration when designing their next women's wristlet rfid wallet.<br />****update: This color has grown on me and I really do Like this color a lot now!!😁",B00JVU1EC8,B00JVU1EC8,AENYWAIKWII6XLZUSC3TBIRNDWUQ,1488055146000,3,True

5.0,Better than I expected!,"The bag is well constructed- I have used this to carry 8, 7' bass fishing rods with reels attached.  In addition, the extra storage pockets (2) hold line spools and as many as 5 baitcasting reels extra on the side pockets.  Understand that the length of this doens't accomodate full coverage or protection from crushing.  You can zip the rod slots all the way up to trap the rods in place with 3-4 ft. of all rods stowed exposed.  Zippers seem to be well made and work smoothly.  Material is heavier than I would have expected.  Got caught out in a rainstorm and got soaked Zippers are not water proof but I knew that to start with.  This is a great way to carry 6-8 rods when you need to fish from your partners boat and carry your gear.  You can get at least two rods/reels in each of the three zipper slots including spinning reel tackle.  you have to stagger the lay in the slots of course but it is roomy enough to do that.

Anyone buying these scarves should be aware there's going to be a wait but despite that ALL ARRIVED a good bit SOONER than the first date of each span given.<br /><br />Each time I received one parcel from overseas containing the majority of the scarves on the order---admittedly all bunched together in a paper shipping envelope but individually packaged in cellophane---and all arrived safely with no ironing required before wearing.  The remainder followed not too long afterwards, either singly or with 2 or 3 in a package.<br /><br />With the exception of one scarf which was shorter than I expected which limited its use somewhat, all are attractive and of good quality, especially CONSIDERING THEIR PRICE.  Had these been pricey scarves I would have never ordered several.<br /><br />To sum it up, I'm having a great time playing with the options---check &#34;personal video&#34; sites for inspiration---that longer scarves allow and, all things considered, I'm as happy with this scarf as I am those in my other orders.",B00H9WV0OM,B00H9WV0OM,AFGZP7MWSXQ4XWWRWXL5JN77VFLQ,1400197118000,5,True

I have encountered a fair number of these types of belts from all manner of companies, and they all are pretty much sink or swim on these two issues: Can it thread through my belt loops on my pants, and can they hold up my pants (within reason) no matter what I attach to the belt/put in my pockets?<br />Personally, I no longer hold tactical belts to the belt loop standard, they are usually too big for the loops, and if they are not, they are quite difficult to get in and out, so it does not bother me that this product, like all the other tactical belts I have tried, has failed that test. I have workarounds for the different types, the quick release type I just fasten on my waist and forget even trying the loops, cinch it tight, and go about my day.<br />In regards to the other pass/fail question, it is sturdy enough to hold up to most reasonable weights one might put on a belt/pants combo, even without threading through belt loops, but I could see it floundering under some individuals concealed carry needs if the weapon is too heavy.<br />The price of this belt is 17 dollars, cheap compared to many other offerings, but within its marketplace I think it is a little high for the quality. The buckle is quality (could be smaller to fit in belt loops, but that seems to be asking for too much from the product type) but the webbing could be sturdier. All in all, a good belt for the price but could be better.",B0BX58FSNK,B0C23SWC1R,AFRIRXI7B5R73DHY55GK42AX35VQ,1682806770649,0,False

You'd definitely have to twist the necklace or intertwine the strands prior to wearing if you want it to look anything like the picture.<br /><br />I knew they wouldn't be round nor of flawless quality, but I didn't think they'd have noticeable rings (?  Seams? or whatever you'd call them) around the middle.  This characteristic is much more prominent on the beige colored pearls; actually, at first I thought it was thin plastic adhered to the pearls to keep them together. If they were cheaper I'd probably keep them, but I just feel like I can get more uniform and attractive jewelry elsewhere.

5.0,Great Aluminum (not Iron) Auto-Tilt Umbrella,"I go through umbrellas very fast. Mostly because I put them in sleeves in a salt water pool. I've gone through a variety, and I now have three Tempera umbrellas. My oldest one has held up incredibly well. The fabric doesn't fade like less expensive umbrellas and most importantly, the bodies are aluminum and not iron. This makes them both lighter weight, but also much better in handling wet environments. The iron umbrellas always end up rusting out, even with the powder coating.<br /><br />This Tempera umbrella was super easy to assemble, it literally took 30 seconds. The tilt mechanism is a an auto-crank which I far prefer to manual tilt mechanisms. You just simply keep cranking and it automatically tilts!<br /><br />I really like the chili red color, it's not super bright and has a bit of a texture to it. The fabric feels thicker and more durable than other umbrellas, and like I said, my older Tempera hasn't faded at all so I have high expectations for this one.

5.0,"Looks great for the cost - Doesn't ""look"" or feel cheap","**UPDATE**<br />My mother in law has had this since Christmas 2018, and in that time she's let my SUPER destructive 2-year-old play with the bracelet it is on at LEAST 10 times, and it has held up absolutely great!  I'm honestly VERY impressed with the quality of this charm.  I was certain it would be the first to break on her Pandora bracelet, and it has yet to (and I know he has tried to break it.  He tries to break everything he touches.)<br /><br />I bought this for my mother in law for Christmas because I knew she was doing something extravagant for me, but I just didn't have the funds to get her a legitimate charm from Pandora.<br />I made up for the lack of funding by making her a heart-shaped box by hand that was lined with Red Panne (A sort of stretchy velour similar in look to velvet - Think Christmas Tree Skirts) so she appreciated that at least.<br /><br />The charm itself looks amazing given how tiny these things are.  The wording was VERY easily legible unlike many of these cheaper charms on Amazon.  The plating appeared to be done very well, and I KNOW plating, given that my family owns one of the last Hard-Plating shops in America!  Getting an accurate plating on something that's this small, and has as many tiny corners as it does is nearly impossible, so there WILL be tiny flaws that are barely noticeable to the naked eye (and probably won't be visible to someone that isn't trained to see them the way I am.)<br />It doesn't appear to be a hard-plate, so it won't last a lifetime, but I've no doubts that it'll at least last a good few years if not longer.  They say it's sterling silver, but I'm not too sure about that claim.  I'm pretty certain it's a plating just because of the inconsistencies in the corners.  (Again, one of those things you only notice when you're trained to.)<br /><br />I tried to crush it with my fingers to see if it was plated pewter or anything of the sort, and it held steadfastly, so it's at LEAST a decent grade stainless steel under the plating which is good since you don't have to worry about it bending, or warping.<br /><br />Overall, I'd DEFINITELY recommend buying this.

The chain is definitely long while the piece is large (everyone loves it!!!). In addition, the structure, sculptural design, and as well as the texture is truly remark here. This piece looks like it was made from antiquity as if it was buried in an ancient treasure chest filled with dirt, all while carrying a multidimensional texture and start of the art design. I would recommend anyone to buy this piece for either themselves and/or for someone as a gift. I definitely will continue to do business with Kemet Art again.

5.0,"sturdy, secure, and perfectly constructed","This is a large, sturdy women's wallet which is made of leather embossed with a basket weave design. It is not heavy, but the sides of it are thick and feel durable as there appears to be some sort of inner backbone in the wallet. This makes it hold its shape very well when you open it as well as keeps anything you put in it well-protected from bending or snapping. The exterior embossing adds interest to the design as well as prevents fingerprints from appearing on the surface. The stitching on mine was perfectly straight and secure with no stray threads or mistakes (not even on the rounded edges).<br /><br />The interior contains 8 dedicated card pockets and two long pockets. The center has a zippered compartment (ideal for coins) and an adjacent &#34;wall&#34; in which to put bills. The wallet is large enough to store American bills without folding. The exterior zipper keeps everything secure in the wallet even when it is very full. The zipper has a gold toned metal fob which makes the zipper easy to grab and pull. The exterior zipper is very smooth on mine and works easily which is somewhat surprising since it is a large teeth metal zipper and they can often be sticky by nature. The interior zipper is nylon and mine also functioned perfectly. Though the wallet is made out of leather, which often has a distinctive smell, my wallet had no odor whatsoever. This may be related to the &#34;breathable&#34; cloth mesh bag that it is shipped in allowing any leather processing chemicals to vent before it is received.<br /><br />This is a very nice wallet for someone who wants something which has a high capacity, sturdy build, and secure packaging for cards and cash. If you have issues with things falling out of your wallet, this is an excellent option.<br /><br />Note: I was given a free sample of this product for my assessment.",B011EI93GI,B011EI93GI,AGXNNDGBBN7K2RJQQW7UBR347SZA,1448992999000,2,False

5.0,Can't wait to order more sunglasses from this brand!,"Absolutely love these sunglasses. I don't buy $$$ sunglasses because I tend to lose or break mine. And let's be honest, trends change so much, why spend big bucks for sunglasses you won't be wearing in a year or two. The packaging out of the box told me these were going to be quality sunglasses. I especially like the case and lens wipe that came with because I never use anything but to clean my glasses and sunglasses. The design is on par with Dolce & Gabanna or Ray Ban aviators. A sleek classic look that will never go out of style. They're also a nice weight so I know they won't fall apart on me and won't break if I accidentally drop them. They're also very well constructed which totally shocked me at this price point. Sometimes you try on sunglasses and they sit crooked on your face, and the more you adjust the worse they get...not the case with these. The nose piece seems easily adjustable (none needed for me), and the hinges for the earpieces are nice and tight. The tint of the lenses is also spot on. I live in Texas...the flat state...and drive due west every day after work into the blinding sun. Since using these sunglasses I notice I don't wince as much on the drive. I also like that they're dark enough that people can't see my eyes when I'm wearing them. I normally hate shopping for clothing or accessories online because you never know what the quality will be like, now how they're going to fit and I hate dealing with returns if they don't. I don't have anything to worry about with these.<br />P.S.- I'm one of those people who only read the negative reviews of products when shopping online.

Also the pockets on mine are fake, you can't put your hands in them, which is weird or they were sewn shut, I'm not sure. If you have a very short torso this will fit you, but be sure you read the length in the item description careful and hold a measure up to yourself before you buy.

Its also clearly transparent and see thru.  I wish it fit me the way i wanted it too but you get what you pay for.  The only thing that was accurate was the skirt, came mid-thigh maybe slightly longer.  I could wear this dress if i planned to have a tank top & slip that matched because again... very see thru.

4.0,"High Quality, Nice Look, Minimal Smell","I had purchased a pair of Hunters before I read the tons of online reviews about their now being made in China and the unending issues with the quality and lack of long-term durability. Upon opening the box, I was met with the noxious smell of rubber. I had heard this was an issue for many as well. I am particularly sensitive so I knew they would have to go back for this reason alone. It turns out they had sent me the incorrect size anyways so they definitely had to go back anyways.<br /><br />After reading the Hunter reviews, I noticed that people kept mentioning Aigles which are made in France. Amazon was selling them for much less than their retail website and with super fast shipping so I went ahead and ordered the Equibelle b/c I really liked the look of this particular boot. The box it came in was completely crushed and crumpled like it had been through much wear and tear but the boots inside were fine. I like that the calf width is more narrow than most rubber boots and doesn't have an adjustment strap. I usually wear a US size 8 boot so I had ordered the UK size 39. It is roomy enough that I can wear a bulky pair of wool socks w/o them feeling tight. There seems to be a bit of extra room at the top of the foot area where the ankle and the foot meet. This makes the boot look a little sloppy when walking. I love the blue color strip at the top. It appears to be made of actual strip of blue rubber vs. black rubber that has just been painted blue so I'm hoping it will not wear or chip off. The blackness of the boot when compared to a true black like a pair of leggings is more of a dark gray and is not as polished as it appears in the picture. I had hoped to be able to wear these with a nicer outfit to work but they don't look quite dressy enough for that. They are super comfy for walking about on pavement though my feet do sweat a bit in them so I would never wear them w/o absorbent socks.<br /><br />So glad I found these!

5.0,Beautiful Gem in Real Sterling Silver,"[[VIDEOID:55ac7a52b61ffd7a659ad39fa5a60f13]] The RUISENT 1 Carat White Moissanite, platinum plated, 6-prong diamond engagement ring with adjustable band arrived as a size 5.5-6.0 US. It fit my size 5.5 finger perfectly until I showed it to my husband. He saw the adjustable band and had adjusted it significantly outward before I could stop him! Sadly, I hadn’t had a chance to put it on my mandrel yet to confirm actual arrival size.<br /><br />The great news is that it IS adjustable. When my husband pulled the ring sides outward and then I pushed the sides back in to fit my finger again, there was zero issue with chipping, flaking, or buckling nor was there any other negative effect. The only thing I don’t care for about adjustable bands on rings is that no matter how discrete and well-done the design, it still gets my hair caught in it when I try to put up a ponytail or run fingers through my hair. I’ve lost more than a few hairs to these types of rings. *grimace*<br /><br />The ring arrived with a very cool box and a polishing cloth. What it did not arrive with was a certificate of authenticity for the gem. I will be having it tested by my jeweler as soon as I can (as I have done with all the other Moissanite gems I have received). I’ll report back with an edit once I have a yay or nay from the jeweler.<br /><br />The ring box…. Even the ring box is a sight to behold. Very much a high quality jewelry store box. There’s a tiny LED in the lid that casts a glow on the gem to make it give a rainbow of sparkle immediately upon opening the box (see photos). The box color is a vibrant, bold, electric blue that has a shimmer to it. I honestly love the box nearly as much as the ring.<br /><br />Overall, I’d say this is a beautifully stunning, high quality gem that is worthy of a more high quality setting. I’m actually contemplating having a ring made and placing this RUISENT 1.0 Carat Moissanite gem into it. All of the little gems would find new homes in the new band as well.

5.0,great for circulation.,This is a product review for Go2 Compression Socks for Women and Men Athletic Running Socks for Nurses Medical Graduated Nursing Compression Socks for Travel Running Sports Socks. I received the white compression socks in white and in a size small. This is a great product for any athlete or nurse. My husband is an elite runner and my sister is a nurse and they both love this product. These compression socks are great to help with calf pain and some foot pain that we as runners sometimes experience.  They provide just the right amount of compression throughout which really helps aid in circulation while exercising. They also are a huge benefit for a nurse or someone who is standing quite a bit for their profession.  The small is the perfect size for a size 7.5 to 9. It is a wide range but definitely a great product. I have enjoyed the use of the compression socks and definitely think they should be in every runner’s wardrobe.

First of all, it’s very tacky to send the chain in a little baggie and the pendant in a separate little baggie. Yuck. Secondly, and much more offensive, is discovering that the pendant will not fit onto the chain! I tried pushing it through and pulling all through. I tried pulling it through with needle-nosed tweezers, all while feeling as if it were going to break with the maneuvering. The little circle on the heart won’t fit through the little circle on the necklace. I’m assuming the person packaging the necklace couldn’t get the pendant on the chain and finally through in the towel and packaged the pieces separately! Returning.

4.0,Great hat,"A few years ago, when I first began to work at different summer camps I began to wear brightly colored trucker caps pretty much at all hours of the day. I did this because I like to upcycle them and make them fit my style, but it also helps with the Texas heat that was common in that area. I used to have a yellow trucker cap that I loved dearly but unfortunately due to excessive wear and tear I had to lay it to rest, after this I decided to start looking for a new cap to replace it and I eventually landed on this one. This cap was very good quality for what I paid for it and I loved the bright color of it as bright colors are typically something I'm attracted to. I put my own twist on it and added a smiley face on the back to make it a little more fun and it worked perfectly for what I was looking for. I wore that cap for quite a time and loved it dearly however it was a little thicker and bulkier than I had intended for it to be. The old yellow cap that I used to have fit my head perfectly and was rather malleable and this one didn't feel that way, and I didn't like that kind of feel as much. I personally thought that looked good backwards but I have never really thought of the trucker caps as good looking when they are worn in the proper way as they tend to pop up on the top of my head, but for me this is all trucker caps and not just this one in particular. It was a very good quality hat and after a few washes it tended to loosen up a little bit and work better, though it never got to be perfect. If you're looking for a trucker cap because its something you just like to wear or it's your style then by all means go for it but if you're just looking for a typical run of the mill cap than you might be more interested in a baseball cap rather than a trucker cap, but that is just my personal opinion.",B00JW3ZGOG,B00JW3ZGOG,AFQV7WWFHFHXOKPCHM3JI3X5H3YA,1448682667000,1,True

Good length maybe 31ish. For me, perfect w a cowboy boot. Got scared reading they got all  linty. Washed inside out came out perfect; I doubt it would have been a problem rightside out. Maybe the lint filter needed to be changed or something that sheds got mixed in or maybe that happens after a few washings? Hope not! Only complaint is I'd prefer the hem to be more like a levi hem not around 1 inch then you see that yellow stitching. It not too too thick but def better if other way.

3.0,"Cute design, fit issues","For the purposes of this review I am 5'8"" and a 36B, I typically wear a size small in women's sizes. So when I was offered this BETTE BOUTIK tunic shirt in wine I thought I would try it. Now I should have ordered the size medium as that is what the chart indicated I should order, but I instead got a small because I wanted it to be more fitted than what I saw on the model. That was my mistake (I did take into account other reviews that mentioned problems with fit and went ahead with it) and you don't need to repeat it (also not why I marked it at a 3 star shirt).<br /><br />This shirt *almost* fit me, the body of the shirt does stretch and I'm not large chested, but it did sit awkwardly in my chest area AND the sleeves are terrible. I believe that if the sleeves had just a tad bit more room the shirt would have actually fit me as it would have allowed the chest area fabric to relax. Sleeves are FAR too slim, and I have very small arms. They were so tight that they stretched the boat neckline of the shirt so it didn't fit right and kind of stood up awkwardly. I felt like my arms put on a very tight pair of jeans that didn't quite get up past the thighs if you can relate. The sleeves are what made this a 3 star shirt for me not just because they were so tight but they are made from a fabric that doesn't stretch much at all so it was uncomfortable to wear, and it's kind of like a non-stretch spandex so also not breathable. It's a cute design but the fit is definitely off for me.<br /><br />Positives: If I had ordered a medium I'm still suspect about the sleeves but it would have fit *better*, the sleeves were definitely long enough on the small for me (long arms here). The shirt had no manufacture flaws that I could see and the body fabric was soft and comfortable feeling. So if the shirt does fit you, you will probably like it if you also like the way it fit the model which is more of a boxy/boyfriend style, just make sure you order per the size chart or size up as some have suggested.",B08KD25SP8,B08KD25SP8,AHCEDKGE26XM7BF3R6FST5FH6K4A,1606987206239,0,False

5.0,Amazing quality!  I like them better than my Rayban Wayfarers,"I purchased a pair of these to be a beater pair to wear in place of my rayban RB2140's I love so much.  I saw the picture of the item described and decided to take a chance.  The quality of the tortoise shell model is outstanding.  they have full metal supports down the legs like my Raybans do and the hinge seems to be of great quality.  The tortoise shell acetate is comparable to the rayban pair and the fit and function is top notch.<br /><br />They are accurate to the size quoted on the listing, slightly smaller than my 54mm bans. They also do not have the aggressive angle of the classic wayfarers, more like a mix between the new RB2130's and the RB2140's we all know and love. The polarization is even and professionally done, and the brown tint looks amazing.",B01AJSTPUS,B01AJSTPUS,AH5BAVUYRQLN6NC7AL2BHKYNHSYA,1493156783000,1,True

I saw some reviews on YouTube before I bought this watch but it didn’t seem to be really small, turns out when I saw the watch that I bought it was so small like if it was made for women, the strap is very short and I don’t even have a big wrist but it was so difficult to but it on anyways. I like the look of the watch yes, and it’s a good watch specially because it’s a COSC trust me it’s worth it, if I would recommended? Yes!

3.0,Borderline bell bottoms make them questionable for work,"As a pair of work jeans, these feel pretty good. The fit at the waist is comfortable and is snug without being tight, which is ideal for work situations. The material feels like it can take some days working out in the yard, which is great, since that's how I intend to use them.<br /><br />The nice, deep pockets are great for work situations, too, perfect for small items and ensuring they won't pop out of your pockets. And finally, a degree of flame resistance is great.<br /><br />All great traits for work pants.<br /><br />But WOW, they run longer than they should by a good bit, bunching WAY up at my shoes.<br /><br />More importantly, the bottoms are so wide and billowy I almost felt like I was reliving the days of bell bottoms. From a fashion standpoint this is no big deal, if you're into that kind of fit and look, but if you're going to wear these jeans while doing physical labor, that poses a problem. The last thing you need is excess material that can snag on things, get caught on something, or otherwise trip you up.<br /><br />I'm not looking for skinny jeans here -- I don't even LIKE a ""skinny"" fit -- just something that I won't be getting caught on chicken wire or snagged on garden equipment.<br /><br />Everything from the knees up is GREAT! Everything below is a thumbs down.<br /><br />If you're tall and thin these issues may not be as bad, but me personally, I would not get a second pair of them.",B09BJ31QGL,B09BJ31QGL,AEVQNKERDSNYGGH7SBYHJKEWAQDA,1639524315910,2,False

If you are busty, you may want to order up a size or maybe even more. I have a small chest and the button closure is *almost* bursting for me; the little flap of extra fabric is really a great added detail that saves this dress big time, and there's additional buttons on the inside of the tummy area to make sure it stays closed.<br /><br />I purchased the cream/purple pattern and in my opinion the only thing that needs ironing is the inside flap so it lays flat (I used my hair straightener for this since it's such a small area!). The rest didn't wrinkle too much for me.<br /><br />As stated in the description, it does shrink down a little upon first wash. I ordered a medium and it was slightly large before washing, but it fits beautifully now that I've washed it.

I must have a shorter torso than most because I felt like I could pull the suit down for more coverage around my butt and thighs (but it didn't look quite right, to be honest). I agree with some other reviews that the cups are bigger than expected, but they are flatter and somewhat padded. So they ended up giving me an extra boost in the bust, which I don't mind. The material is thinner than my old Old Navy swimsuit, but it isn't see-through and is comfortable. I didn't see any loose seams or tears either, so I'm hopeful that it'll keep! I haven't worn this out to the beach or into the water yet, so I don't know what the wear and tear will be like.

The band itself is very substantial, not thin and cheap. One added bonus is that you could replace the very nice buckle with your original pebble buckle and it will fit perfectly and will give it the oem look.<br />I highly recommend this very modestly priced band.<br />Ps, I don't always write reviews.

I didn't want it to look like I bought a size too big. I guess just because I'm tall and have boobs.. it made the dress length a little shorter.

5.0,I feel like I stole this one!,"A couple of weeks back I was perusing Orient watches late in the night and saw this model for $49.95. Usually, the Orient Chicane models are well over $100, so I ordered it. What a nice watch! It keeps very accurate time ...within 3 or 4 seconds a day. I recently learned that Seiko owns a controlling interest in Orient, a brand I was not familiar with, a few months back. Their watches seem to be more accurate than similarly-priced Seiko automatic watches. I've bought 4 different Orient watches in the past few months and have been very impressed with both their construction and accuracy. They deserve to be better known! There are relatively few retail outlets to purchase them, so buying them on Amazon at a low price is a no-brainer. This watch is about the same size as a plethora of the Seiko 5 series, so if you're shopping for one of them, you might want to cross-shop similar Orient models. This watch can be used for casual or dress wear. The leather band is very well made and not one of those cheapie ones that comes on a $30 watch. The black face with contrasting large numbers at the 12,6 and 9 positions make it easy to read for those of us with aging eyes! All-in-all, I got a very nice watch for not much money!

For all the time before that, I thought one piece bathing suits just looked terrible on me. I have been wearing this suit all summer, and I am absolutely thrilled with it! The ruching is super flattering, and the legs are cut high enough to give a nice long leg line, but not so high they make you feel like you're going to be wearing a thong without meaning to. I know butts are everywhere these days, hanging out all over the beaches, but I don't tan all over in a tanning bed, and I don't need to be blinding people on the beach with my pale white tush! I'm also very impressed with the quality of this bathing suit for the price! I bought much more expensive suits from other places, and none of them came close to being as nice as this one. I don't remember now if the cups came lined, but it does have openings for pads. I have combined two sets of pads for the lift I'm looking for. The one thing I will say about this suit is that it's not super supportive on top, so if you're a more boobylicious lady than I (36D), this might not be the best pick.",B01LZN7QEK,B01LZN7QEK,AHQ653L456E7ZX3Z5KC3YFFGNOKA,1502202148633,4,True

I have no waist/hips, just pretty much straight with a muffin top but the waist of this dress is high enough to hide that and give me nice shape. The zipper is a little sticky but the material is stretchy enough to go over your head if you don't want to deal with that.  Colors are exactly like I expected, bright and bold.  The sash/belt is pretty cheap, just a wide black ribbon rather than a nice sewn belt/sash but since the dress itself seems to be made well, I don't mind spending a few bucks to get a nice belt/sash.

Soft and comfortable!  goes with patterned leggings I have, jeggings and my straight leg jeans!  It is important to look at the bust size on the sizing chart when choosing the tunic!  I am broad shouldered and busty so in US Sizes I wear a L to XL but my bra size is a 42C so I tend to err on the side of a little bit larger for shrinkage if cotton or rayon fabrics involved as I am tall -5'7 1/2 &#34;tall...The fit is wonderful...If you are smaller shouldered you might want to go down to a smaller size...

5.0,An Attention Grabber,"I have been fascinated by ouroboros and snakes for years.  In case you don’t know what a ouroboros is it is an ancient Greek symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. The ouroboros eats its own tail to sustain its life, in an eternal cycle of renewal.<br /><br />This ring says it’s for a man but I found it to be unisex and I’m not a guy so there ya go.  It’s not a shiny ring but made of pewter and its lead free.  Great detail work using black to accentuate the snake’s scales and make the ring look old.  The Swarovski crystal green eyes were the finishing touch.  Maybe used because green is the color of new growth in nature?  I liked it because it’s seems like a Slytherin kind of ring and I sorted into that house on Pottermore.<br /><br />I love how it looks on my pointer finger.  It’s definitely an attention grabber.

5.0,Far Exceeded Expectations,"Far exceeded my expectations. I didn’t want to write a review till I washed the socks a few time because anyone who buys wool socks knows that after you wash them a few times the cheap ones will lose all form and need to be constantly pulled up throughout the day. I am happy to say these have not lost their shape and require no adjustment throughout the day. When I I totally received them they felt soft but I questioned the thinness of the material. It turned out that they weren’t as thin as originally thought and while not super thick, the thickness is perfect for both providing warmth while allowing moisture to escape. The first morning I had them I went for about a three mile walk, with an outside temp around 25 degrees wearing walking shoes. Usually with normal white exercise socks my feet get cold and numb, or when I put on the thick warm camping socks I have, they get hot and extremely moist. These socks left my feet in the perfect condition. Warm and not moist. I was really pleased because the price point was almost generous. When I initially saw the price I just assumed they would be a three month sock before I bought more. That’s not the case at all. So in sum, the quality, comfort and price make these socks easily five stars. A really great find. Thank you ViGrace! I’m looking forward to trying other products you have on amazon. I’m not going to add a picture because I’m not a feet guy, but the stock picture is accurate as to what it looks like.",B08JG5KJ29,B08JG5KJ29,AHSCP3ZOLUEG6UUTZX7LWQPKPJJA,1604850197657,2,True

2.0,You get what you pay for...,"After the frame of my old and trusty MTB sunglasses snapped in half, I bought these HiHiLLs, together with the [[ASIN:B06XPB8ZDM Torege Polarized Sports Sunglasses With 4 Interchangeable Lenses for Men Women Cycling Running Driving Fishing Golf Baseball Glasses EMS-TR90 Frame TR033]]. This way I could directly compare the fit, looks and quality of both.<br /><br />It’s a clear case of “you get what you pay for”, as the Toreges, although slightly higher priced, are the better glasses. The sizing and fit of these HiHiLLs is horrible: the frame is way too wide, and the glasses sit too high and too much forward on my nose (probably to make room for the myopia lens insert). The photos show how the Torege frame will give a much tighter and smoother fit and therefore a better look. I also prefer the more glossy finish of the Toreges, as compared to the cheap plastic matte look of these HiHiLLs. The comfort of the nose bridge is similar: unfortunately not great, but hopefully satisfactory for a 1-2 hour bike ride.<br /><br />Considering the number of accessories and value for money, these glasses could deserve 3 stars, were it not for the poor, unacceptable coating on the multicolored (rainbow) lens: one corner was missed completely, resulting in an asymmetrical finish, rendering the lens useless for me.

3.0,Great Product for a Low Price; Inconsistent Fit and Brim Height,"Please see the July 28, 2016 review posted by Terrence Craft.  His review is thorough and generally well done.<br /><br />My additional feedback:<br /><br />- Size.  The small/medium size I ordered fits like a large, and the circumference of the hat doesn’t match the expected size or fit.<br /><br />- Brim.  I own more expensive porkpie style hats, each of which have low cut brims that make the satin multi-colored band around the crown more prominent.  The height of the brim on this hat is too tall for a porkpie style hat.  I used a pair of shears to cut down the height of the brim so the satin multi-colored band is more prominent.  I posted a photo of my hat with the excess brim material that I trimmed off.<br /><br />- Re-Sized Fit.  I took the excess strip of brim material, trimmed it’s length down to fit the exact circumference of the hat, and then tucked the strip inside the hat’s sweat band and completely around the sweat band’s circumference to improve the fit.  This re-fit idea worked well and I now have a hat that fits properly.<br /><br />- Accessories.  Received the socks; no feather received, however.<br /><br />- Color.  The natural color is closer to a dark beige because the straw material has light tan graphics woven throughout the hat, which makes the overall color darker than the natural straw color I expected and preferred.<br /><br />- Quality. This is a well-made hat for the low price point.  I wasn’t worried about trimming off material from the brim to reduce its height because the hat’s material construction is well-stitched and strongly-fused with adhesive.<br /><br />I’d recommend this product despite the sizing and brim height issues (which lowered my rating) because it’s still a quality product for a low price.",B01E69DDKE,B01E69DDKE,AFCEKN7LCKOV5BAYY7Z3537JKZPQ,1530422612563,2,True

5.0,"Great basic runner's headband for colder months... though, personally, I think it runs a little small.","Great headband... though it seems to run a little small for me.<br /><br />The headband fits well enough over my head, and holds a ponytail well. I wish to some degree that it had the ponytail part up higher, as I prefer a higher ponytail (keeps it off my neck) but that would be a part of the decision in finding one to buy. I did find that I could only wear it for a short time, however, as it was not very elastic and seemed to run rather small size-wise. I ended up with a headache after wearing it for not too long, but it seems like a well constructed item and from what I can tell is exactly as described in the listing, so it would make sense that it would be a good piece if what you're looking for is what's described here in the listing.<br /><br />But again, protip: if you have a decently large head or tend to get headaches from tight headbands, you may want to keep looking elsewhere for one that runs a little bigger. I will probably actually be giving this one to my sister, who is overall smaller than myself, as she is a very active person and I can see her making good use of one of these!<br /><br />With that in mind, I would definitely recommend this, from my limited use, for someone who is looking for a good basic ear warmer/ponytail headband, is athletic or wants to be outside in the colder months, and has an average to smaller sized head. If there are any unexpected discoveries with this item as my sister uses it, I will return and update my review. Until such time as that happens, though, I would definitely say this headband is worth a buy!<br /><br />For disclosure purposes, I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. HOWEVER, like I have said on any product which I have acquired in this fashion, I did NOT buy this product for kicks, I actually purchased it because it's something I would have looked around for and probably purchased anyway, discount or no. For this reason, and because I still paid money for it, I am just as critical of this item as another reviewer would be, because I don't want a crappy item any more than the next person. With that said, this review outlines my honest opinions, and is in no way influenced by sellers or websites, or anyone except maybe extra input from family members and friends.

5.0,"Comfortable, stretchy pants suitable for workouts","There appear to be two kinds of yoga pants: stretchy slacks that are cut rather like most pants, and fitted tights that hug your legs and butt (for good or ill). These are in the latter category.<br /><br />I like them a lot. The yoga pants manage to be snug without being tight. They fulfill their destiny, in that they're flexible and lightweight, and they stretch just-fine when I'm working out. Also, the pants went through the washer and dryer without a problem.<br /><br />And did I mention that they look good? It's like I am walking around with racing stripes.<br /><br />They're cut true-to-size; my Small was just right. I'm short (5'1""), and the ""extra"" fabric schooched just-right around my calves. (By which I mean, I do not look like a dork.) I think they'd be fine for someone up to 5'5""... or taller, if you don't care about workout pants being short.<br /><br />The yoga pants advertise a back pocket, but don't get your hopes up. The only thing that'd fit into that ""pocket"" is a locker key. If you want to stick your phone in a pocket while you work out, you're out of luck. There'd be no place for a real pocket on pants this form-fitting! That's not a problem as long as you set your expectations correctly.<br /><br />I like these yoga pants.

5.0,Can't beat it for the money!,"I ordered a couple of sets of these for various kids this Christmas, and the results were uniformly good.  The build quality is solid, apparently either stainless steel or chrome plated something-something, and of course the loupes close, so they protect themselves reasonably well from e.g. impact and dirt; they're not as tiny as some higher-end instruments (Belomo, Nikon) so they're a little easier for the tots to grok; the optical quality is plenty for garden-variety use (chromatically way better than some of my other cheapies); and at a couple bucks apiece, they're cheap enough that loss/casualty scenarios can be survived without financial anguish / wailing / gnashing of teeth.  30x seems a little generous to me for the magnification number, but my eyeball guess was that they magnify a single dimension around 5x-6x--that is, a 1mm thing will look like a 5-6mm thing--and if you square that, you're right in the neighborhood of 30x, so this claim may indeed be valid by some metrics and not by others.  The inside edges of the cover are just the tiniest bit sharpish, so I suppose a determined child could cut a finger, but this seems like a pretty minimal hazard for a kid who is old enough to grasp the concept of magnification.  They ship in pairs, with each one in a little plastic case exactly as pictured.

It's been a long time since I tried on pantyhose, and they survived with minimal damage and no runs. I am 5'3"", 119 lbs, and typically wear a size small in bottoms. The size medium was a perfect fit, so they do run small. You'll want to size up if you are average height or carry a bit more weight.

1.0,You Have GOT To Be KIDDING ME!  (See Photo Comparison),"I recently discovered this new style of underwear that I love.  It is comfortable and it is soft and cotton.  I really like it. I have it from two different companies and both run the same in sizing.  I saw these and saw they were the same so I ordered them according to the size chart- BIGGER than I normally do.<br /><br />FABRIC<br />The fabric of these is very thin.  It is stretchy but not over the top.  The bands are so soft that they almost feel like they are not entirely cotton which is a NO for me.<br /><br />SIZING<br />My GOD this is unreal.  I have posted a picture for you of the same style I have in these underwear from another company in a LARGE.  They fit fine and are fantastic underwear.  On the other side of the photo are these in a size X-LARGE.  They are TINY in comparison!  Keep in mind these are supposed to be LARGER than the others.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />These are way off in sizing.  They are not at all like the others of this type that I have gotten and the fabric is very thin too.  These really were not at all what they should have been.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  These are more like an X-LARGE for young girls, not Misses sizes.  The quality was not great either.",B093ZQG6YP,B093ZQG6YP,AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,1626376867845,0,False

3.0,Black not 100% black but still cute.,Update: hubs washed/dryed these for me and now they're a size smaller and super tight. Not as comfortable.

I'm 5&#34;6 @135 and they are a little long but not bad. Easily can do a roll cuff look.<br />Only negative as I think others mentioned black is not a true black. There is fading on the thighs and under the butt. If they had been all black I would give 5 stars but still cute and comfortable to wear. I think the waist is a mid height. Not low where your butt will hang out (I'm a mom and don't need that). These are also not soft. More cheap feel to them. At this point I sort wish I hadn't ordered them.<br />If I had wanted ripped jeans I would have ordered that which means I would have never ordered these.,B01MTZLU8X,B01MTZLU8X,AFIYIMK5O3SH25BC6JD62MVPQHGA,1489000755000,15,True

4.0,So Many Compliments!,"I'm 5'3"" & typically a size 12-14 in dresses (currently 36DD in chest). I ordered a large & find the dress to be quite comfortable.<br />If I had my druthers, it'd be a smidge shorter (by about 1-2""), but wearing wedge sandals takes care of that. And even though it's longer than I would prefer, it doesn't look frumpy or make me feel like I'm being swallowed by material, like some other maxi dresses can.<br />The material is better than I expected too. I'm not sure what it is...most likely a cotton/poly blend (definitely not 100% cotton)...but it's thicker than other dresses I've ordered. Not see-through at all. No bra/panty lines either.<br />I definitely recommend this dress.<br /><br />I bought this dress in the ""grey"" as well. Same great fit, but I was disappointed in the color. The ""grey"" looks more like a heathered blue than the grey in the picture.

Thick canvas absorbs ink well, but doesn't bleed through!","ToteBagFactory Cotton Canvas Tote Bags are made with a thick material that is perfect for screen printing on!

The length of the straps is what I was pleasantly surprised by. Normally, tote bags have short handle straps, but with these straps I am able to carry over my shoulder. The stitching is tight and with the heavy weight material these are quality bags! I highly recommend these bags for screen printing, iron-ons, fabric paints, etc! The 12 pack makes it great for personalizing and giving as gifts!<br /><br />Given sample to test thoroughly and return my personal honest opinion.

1.0,Boo,"Really cute! 3 stars because the left leg is sewn tighter than the right so I had to stretch it out.. Also, part of the lace isn't even attached!

Just a couple minor fixes and they're good.<br /><br />Okay, adding onto this review. After wearing them once, I can hear it ripping every time I get into my car. And they fit me perfectly.. The tear on the lace was easy to fix but a few more have appeared. Of course. The fact that one leg is tighter than the other is really driving me crazy and I've tried everything to fix it. There are loose strings all over, and not just strings, the thick lace ones. And I didn't even receive the bracelet it advertises you should get with it.. No big deal, I wouldn't wear it anyway, it's just weird and ugly, but what bothers me is the empty promise there.. I am pretty disappointed cuz it is a really cute skirt..

4.0,"Quite delicate, but beautiful","*Received at a discount in exchange for my honest review*<br /><br />I absolutely LOVE every piece I've been fortunate enough to review from this seller.  My skin is apt to turn green super easily with costume jewelry, even silver plate doesn't last long with me.  But this company is the real deal: I've showered, gone into the pool, and sweated in their jewelry with absolutely NO reaction.  Heck, even their earring backs are sterling silver.  Plus each item comes in a jewelry box with an included polishing cloth.  I also love how dainty and girly each piece feels.<br /><br />I will comment that I normally prefer my anklets a little less dainty for running around.  This one is really pretty, though.  I like the design, especially, since every other one of the little round beads is free floating, as well as the heart charm.  It's innovative and creative, and I love it!  The bracelet is adjustable as well, and will fit a pretty universal collection on people. I have an average size ankle, and it fit me with room to spare.<br /><br />Overall, really happy with these, and will be wearing this any time I get dressed up!",B01D4NL0Q2,B01D4NL0Q2,AH3GVN2XBPTZA73T4S45G6SQDFSA,1468260970000,2,False

However, I can now say that I am very happy that I made the purchase for her. When she puts this on after swim practice, she is very happy to be warm and comfortable. This jacket is pretty heavy duty. It's heavy and the zipper is awkward. She cannot get the hang of the double zipper. I wish it had just one zipper.

5.0,"Nice semi-puffy jacket with detachable hood, reflective liner, and a YKK front zipper","The main front zipper on the jacket is a nice solid YKK zipper as this is the most important zipper on the jacket. The hood and pocket zippers are not YKK which are less important zippers on the jacket. Reflective liner on the inside with a mesh protective covering helps to reflect the heat back to your body. The hood is detachable so if you really don't use hoods or want a lighter jacket the hood can be removed and stored. The chest is a little bit small compared to the waist of the jacket I guess they are expecting slightly rounder people than brawny.<br /><br />Stitching on the jacket is top notch with no loose threads and very straight seems, I like that the wrist bands are recessed slightly where they are covered by the outside of the jacket. In the snow or rain this helps to keep the wrist bands dry as they are not as exposed to the moisture or rain. It's very uncomfortable to me to have wet wrist bands when it's cold outside.<br /><br />There are front and back heating areas on the jacket with three temperature settings that are color-code to the level of power being used to heat the coils. I couldn't tell exactly how long the battery lasts on the high setting as the heating controls dropped from high to medium within 20 minutes of turning on the heat. The weather has been pretty mild this year, no cold cold days or nights to test how well this keeps you warm but I expect with the heater this jacket would be very comfortable in the mountains.<br /><br />No mention as to the type of material used for waterproofing the jacket so I assume it's not using DuPont Thinsulate or Gore-tex and at the price point of the jacket with the heater and battery I wouldn't expect a name brand waterproof breathable material. Overall I like this jacket and give it a thumbs up.",B09B25FCT1,B0BDDF7CF9,AESUT7B7LETZREI65DP3TY772UMQ,1635833729800,2,False

2.0,not what it seems,My daughter asked what I wanted for my birthday.  I searched the Amazon site for Swiss Army Watch because I like the brand and this came up at the head of the listings.  Being cheap and something my daughter could afford I sent her the link.  When I received it I found it is not a Swiss Army watch.  The box does not include instructions.  The timer bezal is glued in place and does not turn at all so it and the compass bezal are strictly ornamental.  I went to the web site on the box and found that it is not water resistant so the depth meter is just there for show.  This is a good watch for a child that tells time only and has a cool military look.  If you want the actual functions like the bezal and depth meter you will need to spend more money to get them.  I guess you really get what you pay for.,B0089AKDH8,B0089AKDH8,AEHKSIKZ5EF6HFRHJA74U6BDLQ7Q,1395072263000,4,False

2.0,Weird butt flap thing has to go,"Ugh ok. So the compression is mostly great. HOWEVER, the split/butt flap thing in the back is super weird. I have big hips and the top part of the thing digs in around the back of my waist making an odd muffin top where there is none. The edging of that part is really hard. If I pull it down over my hips, I get a line around them, if I pull it up over my hips the weird back muffin top. So I cut the edging and it helped a little (also made the item unreturnable), but THEN I realized that it has a seam that goes across the back exactly where a panty line would be. The whole point of wearing these is to avoid panty lines. I bought it to wear under a catsuit and that line is like all you see. It goes across the butt and down either side of your pelvis. Like an odd thong line. I’ll eventually find something loose enough to wear over this, but that’s the opposite of what it’s supposed to do. Btw, the answer is not a bigger size. If it were bigger, it wouldn’t be supportive enough. It’s just made for a shorter waisted body type with less differential between waist and hips. I’m so sad.

2.0,"Not the Best, not the worst","Edit:<br />So I've had there for about a month and a half now. On top of the fact that 3 didn't screw on properly, I've had 3 balls break. 2 of them broke while I had it in. I felt something after I finished eating and when I pulled it out, it was the bottom ball. I picked it out and it fell apart in my hand. The 3rd one I noticed a crack from the hole to the center and that one fell apart. I know they were cheap, but I didn't think they would fall apart like that. Luckily I didn't swallow the bar and other ball when it broke!!!<br /><br />Well, what do you expect for $6.00?! I ended up with 6 that have skull and crossbones. And 3 don't screw on properly. I guess 23 that are good isn't too bad. I tried all to make sure the balls screw on OK. I had ordered the flexible ones several years ago and had the same issue. I have a lot of metal bars with acrylic balls, but the plastic is more gentle on teeth and I don't have to worry about taking it out every time I have an X-ray or MRI.

I am not looking forward to driving home in them.<br /><br />I would not recommend purchasing anything from this company.  I contacted their customer service department and they keep asking me to provide more information to include pictures of the shoes and a copy of the receipt (which I do not know if I have since I was not planning on having to return them since they fit so well in the store).

It’s best to know your prescription needs from an eye doctor, or at least try on different reading glasses strengths at a local store like Walmart). Anyway, these things are perfect for me. I hate wearing glasses in general, even sunglasses, but I can put these on and forget I’m wearing them. Very comfortable. The amber shading reduces the brightness of the sun without simply making everything dark like typical sunglasses. And they wraparound to block out most of the side light. This is my second pair—the first pair broke through no defect of their own, unfortunately they were smashed at work when I wasn’t even wearing them.

I do not intend to wet these so no comments on that, the suede outer fabric calls to me to keep it dry.

I was hoping to use this as a 2 in one type purse where I could use the inside smaller bag for those errands where you don’t kneed to have everything with you and for vacation travel. What I do like: The construction seems good and I do like that the tote’s inside has that unlined finish.  The bottom will bowe if you have a heavy bag and use the shoulder strap and I’m not sure how long it will stand upright instead of folding over as there is no reinforcement to help it maintain its shape.

Which was fun to notice after having already removed the buckle from my mk watch to switch over.  Next, the color on the brown straps.. not even CLOSE to the pictures and not at all what I needed or wanted, cute enough but still have to continue the search. And last, feels fairly cheap, thank goodness they look nice enough though so if you don’t use them often you might be able to make them last a while.",B0839Q7G5C,B0839Q7G5C,AHWURSZVRSV5PVN6B7T7BEG7WUSA,1623285034449,3,True

2.0,Warning- This shirt has no wearing ease and chart is sized for the Asian market,"The XXL I ordered is an 8-10 at best. I am not overweight and usually wear a 10-12 in shirts, but I ordered the XXL (14) because I have a larger bust, live in a hot climate and wanted the shirt to fit loosely. This shirt didn't fit anywhere. The arms were too tight, the sleeves were too short and it was very fitted, not loose at all. The measurements given must be for the actual inches from seam to seam, not the &#34;sized to fit X inches&#34; we're used to on US/European size charts. US/European sizes incorporate wearing ease, which is actual inches plus enough extra length or width to allow you to move, bend, sit, etc, comfortably. To make this even a fitted shirt, you'd probably have to add at least 2&#34; to the stated measurements on the chart. For a loose fit, add at least 4&#34;. Additionally, the fabric is so see through that if you perspire or get caught in the rain, this shirt will become transparent.<br /><br />I wish that Amazon would require that the sellers of Asian produced clothing either, A) produce clothing to US/European size standards or B) be required to post that the clothing is sized for the Asian market and the stated sizes will be much smaller than expected.  I would wish for option &#34;A&#34; because there are probably good vendors out there that are selling clothing on Amazon that are sized as expected for this market, but as the saying goes, &#34;once bit, twice shy&#34;. Until something changes, either shop for clothing elsewhere or anticipate that your chances of receiving a garment that fits as you expect is a crap shoot at best.",B01GIYN4HM,B01GIYN4HM,AEXYJOQ5WF327PKCOQEYPJRIU4CQ,1533573102251,0,True

4.0,Not cotton,"I like cotton shirts. I had thought this was a cotton shirt because the description says it's cotton. It's not. This is a 100% polyester shirt. It does not look like cotton nor does it feel like cotton. The tag on the shirt shows that it's not cotton.<br /><br />That aside, like other reviewers have said, this shirt sits somewhere between formal and casual. I think it's perfectly work appropriate if you're an office worker. It will look great with a pair of slacks.<br /><br />Even though the tag says machine wash gentle and no tumble dry, I dried it on low heat anyway, and it handled it just fine, except a SLIGHT  wrinkling of the collar seams (see photo). This is a big plus for me, it is also the main reason why I prefer cotton when I buy shirts - I can machine wash and tumble dry it. Line drying is a pain in the butt for me. So, even though this is not made of cotton, I am glad it dried well.<br /><br />It fits very loosely but I think it's super comfortable. I like the flow of the fabric. It doesn't cling to my body. When it came out of the dryer, there wasn't static. It's very nice.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice shirt. Not what I had expected when I ordered it, but I would recommend it. Just know that the style may be a little quirky... I call it a very Chinese FOB style. It's something I'd found very commonly seen in a Chinese speaking country.",B085ZXY1L4,B085ZXY1L4,AG6BLQGKWPSBB4KW7O4LFYTN4ONA,1595141851392,0,False

This definitely can not be worn as a stand alone dress because it is pretty open in the front, unless you wore a slip dress under. I have gotten lots of compliments on it. I wish it came in other colors. I got white because I figured black would be hot, but white is tough for me with 2 boys and sticky hands. Guess when it gets 2 messed up I will dye it.

My only complain on my previous Sharkk wallet was the fact that as soon as you placed to bills inside it got tough to close. This model solved that issue for me, no more complains.

4.0,Picture doesn't do it justice - bracelet looks beautiful on or off your wrist!,"I sell jewelry and I enjoy pieces that are different.  This is not a big, overpowering bracelet.  I have a small wrist and most bracelets are too big for me.  I can adjust this bracelet to the size I want.  Sideways cross represents Gods love for us as far as the east is to the west.  I have found if you criss cross the straps so the bracelet sits at an angle it seems to be the best look (for me).  The strap is soft and the cross is a good size.  My only draw back is the way you secure the bracelet to your wrist.  The bracelet secures with a buckle, but no rod to push through a hole.  It did loosen up throughout the day until I wove it through the straps to give it a braided effect.  I don't like the straps being so long; however, as I mentioned, I do have small wrists and it is to accomodate all wrist types.  If that bothers people they have the option of braiding it through the straps or possibly cutting one side of the strap - I'm too chicken... I don't want to ruin a good thing.  If it wasn't for the length of the strap and having a way to secure the bracelet without it becoming loose (the studs on the strap will makes the strap secure - no worries about it falling completely off) I would have given this bracelet 5 stars - Its a nice bracelet and I have received several compliments.",B008765IME,B008765IME,AEKWHYPHGRK6MEA37OOWVXUY627A,1384106690000,1,True

Now I see why the company didn't put accurate photos online.<br />Obviously the socks are supposed to say ""I just wanna hang with my dog"" but someone messed up big time and printed ""hany"" instead of hang.<br />It would be kind of funny if it wasn't so obvious that the company is trying to deceive buyers. These are referred to as ""funny meme socks"" but if you flip through the photos on Amazon you'll notice that they conveniently leave out the graphics and words. Most likely because if they were to show the actual product no one would buy it.<br />Other than that huge issue, the socks are decent. I wear a women's size 9 shoe and these fit me fine.

Took a little longer than I would have hoped for but considering it was free shipping I cant complain. I'm 32C-28-38, 5'4 and 124lbs and I went with the medium. The bottoms fit well at my waist, they are as high as shown in the picture which is great and they hug my curves just right although they are a little tight on my butt cheek. Not too tight but enough to be bothersome.  As with the last swimsuit I bought, the cups still seem abit on the bigger side. I thought with the added removable padding it would help which it did somewhat, but it still doesn't feel secure I guess. I also noticed the cups are too far apart so I'll be sewing them closer together in hopes that the top will fit better. Overall though, I really do like this swimsuit.

5.0,Its like living in a cloud,"I'm usually a large, but since they were out, I ordered an XL. Its like living in a cloud. The material is soft and durable. The colors won't run in the wash (if you follow the instructions and turn it inside out) and it's been a great addition to my closet. Though I would recommend ordering in your size. It would definitely be worth the wait until they have your size available.",B00MNNJUBM,B009R09Z8W,AGGDZIQDNFDFSTL7ZA6UQ2TPWT6A,1461768571000,0,True
5.0,Great way to pack your clothes,These packing cubes were great when packing for a trip internationally.  They compacted the space in my suitcase and I had extra room in my suitcase.

5.0,This dress is so Beautiful and the colors are nice and bright,This dress is so Beautiful and the colors are nice and bright. Fits as expected as I wear a 12/14 and ordered a XXL.

2.0,"Looks good,  SNAGS clothing!","The watch band is attractive. The rose gold is bright and shiny. Problem #1 - the band is very long and has two magnets to secure it on your risk. Getting it on is cumbersome because the first magnet grabs hold of the metal band, and it's just an odd design. Problem #2 (the main problem), the edges of the band snag EVERYTHING!! I've ruined a couple blouses because of rough edges on this band snagging threads. I would not buy this again due to the snagging.",B09PHDM88N,B09PHDM88N,AEVNRGYPJIQVRXKZGL2M4FX4JFZA,1644517654920,0,True
2.0,"Not the ""size 10"" we're used to","My son is very big for his age (7 year old, around 100 pounds and 4'9"") and usually wears somewhere between a size 10-12 but when it comes to pajamas, he can usually do a size 10 with a little room to spare (as long as it's not the tight fitting ones that toddlers usually wear).<br /><br />The quality of these was also okay, like the Glidan brand clothing, so not very soft.  But then again, I bought this for the pokemon aspect, not for its quality.  My son was really excited when he saw it, but sadly it was way too small (probably at least 1-2 sizes too small) and 10 is the biggest they offer so we'll have to continue our search.",B0842XGC2N,B0842XGC2N,AE23O7X5CMSWALTKTZG4BCAHACGA,1587737157699,0,True
